    <p>Imagine the following: It is the year 2012 and you have been
    invited to a fancy conference dinner in Cambridge. There is
    champagne and you are feeling great. Stephen Hawking is here, good
    grief! You feel like you have made some real progress today, with so
    many interesting talks and discussions. You even managed to plug
    your latest paper to one of the conference chairs. All is well.
    Suddenly a sheet of paper drifts into your field of view. A
    declaration on the topic of the conference - animal consciousness.
    You eagerly sign (eleven other people already did). It’s probably
    alright, you think. Science is about discourse. We are just stating
    our position…</p>

    <h2 id="and-its-predictable-aftermath">… and its predictable

    <p>The subsequent news cycle is as wild as you’d predict. Here’s <a
    href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528836-200-animals-are-conscious-and-should-be-treated-as-such/">New
    Scientist</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>” <em>Animals are conscious and should be treated as such</em>

    </blockquote>
    <p>and <a

    <blockquote>
    <p>” <em>After 2,500 Studies, It’s Time to Declare Animal Sentience
    Proven</em> “.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The declaration has also made it into the reports of some of our
    favorite <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective
    altruism</a> organizations. Here’s the <a
    href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-animal-welfare/#fnref3">Cause
    Profile</a> on effectivealtruism.org:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>” <em>Many experts now believe that animals have conscious
    experiences</em> ”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and (in a footnote of) the Founder’s Pledge<a
    href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/animal-welfare-cause-report">Animal
    Welfare Cause Report</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Similarly, the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, an
    important collection of “unequivocal” statements made by a group of
    prominent neuroscientists in 2012, noted that “the weight of
    evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the
    neurological substrates that generate consciousness”.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, not everybody is as convinced by the declaration. Luke
    Muehlhauser is characteristically awesome by providing a nuanced
    take in the <a
    href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood#footnote231_3530l7i">Report
    on Consciousness and Moral Patienthood</a>, listing three
    caveats:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>1. The document reads more like a political document than a
    scientific document. (See e.g.</em> <a
    href="http://www.consciousentities.com/2012/10/the-cambridge-declaration/">this</a>
    <em>commentary.)</em><br />
    <em>2. As far as I can tell, the declaration was signed by a small
    number of people, perhaps about 15 people, and thus hardly
    demonstrates a “scientific consensus.”<br />
    3. Several of the signers of the declaration have since written
    scientific papers that seem to treat cortex-required views as a live
    possibility, e.g. Koch et al. (2016) and Laureys et al. (2015),
    p. 427.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The <a
    href="http://www.consciousentities.com/2012/10/the-cambridge-declaration/">commentary</a>
    cited in point 1 is an interesting read, although sometimes
    bordering on the polemic:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>What is the Declaration for, and what will it be used for? I
    presume the aspiration is that it will be cited wherever the
    treatment of animals is an issue. Its function is surely meant to be
    to give clarity, but to do it by curtailing argument; to end
    discussion. That’s certainly liable to be the way it is used, at any
    rate. I don’t like that at all; there are cases where it’s
    legitimate to try to close down an area of discussion, but I don’t
    think this is one; the attempt is at best radically premature, at
    worst profoundly unhelpful. If anything we should be promoting
    discussion. Wouldn’t it have been better, and more appropriate to
    Crick’s memory, if the participants in the Conference had, in that
    spirit, published a list of good questions?</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I’ve also asked a couple of colleagues in the field about their
    opinion on the declaration and got responses like these:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Doesn’t make sense to me, and I think they could have written
    the document better and cited their sources more
    responsibly.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>It’s important to take into account the state of mind the
    author was in when writing the article: intoxicated by success and
    champagne.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>I’m not sure about the declaration… But anyway, Stephen
    Hawking was present when they signed it, so it must be
    legit.</em></p>

    <p>Okay, okay, now this post is getting polemic also. Sorry about
    that. Really, I don’t even have a very strong opinion on this. I’m
    not working on the neuroscience of consciousness and (to be frank) I
    don’t <em>get</em> the literature on the topic. Most things I’ve
    skimmed don’t provide definitions or quantifications and the few
    “mathematical” theories of consciousness appear to be deeply <a
    href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1799">flawed and
    confused</a>.</p>
    <p>In contrast, <a

    materialism</a>, the</p>

    <p>” <em>radical claim that our ordinary, common-sense understanding

    role to play in a mature science of the mind</em> ”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>, does not actually sound very radical to me.<sup>[1]</sup> This
    position appears to be (based on my observations) the position
    implicitly adopted by many of my colleagues in the field. Our
    (non-technical) intuitions about how the mind <em><a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology">ought to
    work</a></em> consistently lead us astray and are not useful guides
    when trying to understand complex systems<sup>[2]</sup>. There is no
    principled reason why an overloaded concept like consciousness
    <em>should</em> have a distinct neural correlate. It appears much
    more likely that (as we understand more and more of the brain) the
    questions about consciousness will simply <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mc6QcrsbH5NRXbCRX/dissolving-the-question">dissolve</a>
    and be replaced by more tractable questions.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[1] </p>
    <p>My intuition largely comes from reading “<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">Vehicles</a>”
    by Valentino Braitenberg, which does a tremendous job at
    demonstrating how an automaton programmed with very simple
    instructions performs complex behavior that deludes us into
    attributing higher cognition to the simplest automaton. This is a
    bit ironic since Braitenberg is the Ph.D. advisor of Christof Koch,
    one of the famous editors and signatories of the Cambridge
    Declaration. Or perhaps it’s not ironic but just appropriate.</p>

    “based on definitions of putative functions inherited from
    psychological traditions” in favor of a more principled phylogenetic
    approach. I am very excited about this stuff.</p>

    <p>The question implicit in all the news articles and reports cited
    in the first section is: <em>How should we treat animals?</em> This
    question can be instantiated without reference to
    consciousness<sup>[3]</sup> and the process of doing so will force
    us to confront our implicit assumptions and conceptual confusions.
    This is an important and worthwhile project, but not the topic of
    this post<sup>[4]</sup>. Here I only want to declare that the
    Cambridge Declaration On Consciousness should not be used for a “<a
    href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.F99/Challen/proof/proof.html#:~:text=Proof%20by%20authority%3A%20%22Well%2C%20Don%20Knuth%20says%20it%27s%20true%2C%20so%20it%20must%20be!%22">proof

    change), otherwise it will lose its punch.</p>

    <p>I subscribe to the action items proposed by people working on
    animal welfare - mass farming is an abomination, eating animal
    products is gross and <a

    welfare charities</a> is (probably) a good idea.</p>

    <p>So in this post, I propose the “Frankfurt Declaration on the
    Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness”<sup>[5]</sup>. It is even
    shorter than the original and just reads:</p>

    <p>[5] </p>
    <p>I am acutely aware of the irony that a declaration <em>in favor
    of</em> consciousness would come out of Cambridge (the cradle of
    analytic philosophy) and that I’m writing my declaration from
    Frankfurt (that German town known for… <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School">not being the
    cradle of analytic philosophy</a>). Or perhaps it’s not ironic but
    just appropriate.</p>

    <p>I, a published neuroscientist, don’t understand the
    neuroscientific literature on consciousness. I do not know whether
    animals (including humans) are conscious or not or whether that
    question even makes sense. I could not have signed the Declaration
    On Consciousness in good conscience.</p>

    <p>I hope this statement serves as a <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge">“The
    Emperor’s New Clothes”-type declaration</a> and that I will not
    embarrass myself with <a
    href="https://youtu.be/J-P7yVqJ9Wk?t=233">bravado</a>. I realize
    that I’m punching a bit above my weight here and that the
    signatories of the original declaration are a lot more tenured and
    distinguished than I am. At the same time, a professor I admire
    recently said that the amount of influence a researcher gains over
    the course of their career does not grow exponentially, but actually
    rather sub-linearly. So if you have something to say, just go for
    it. It doesn’t make too much sense to wait until you are more <a
