    <p>It is the season, and I just finished watching the 2003 classic
    “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf_%28film%29">Elf</a>”
    with Will Ferrell as “Buddy”, a human raised among elves at the
    North Pole who travels to New York to reunite with his biological
    father and to save Christmas. The movie got me thinking.</p>
    <p>There is an interesting trope in the movie that’s used as a story
    device: the magical powers of Santa are predicated on humans
    believing in Santa. Thus, Santa falls in the same category as some
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkerbell_effect">magical
    creatures</a>, <a
    href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp">the value
    of fiat money</a> and, arguably, god<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/belief-conditional-things-things#footnote-1-41815715">1</a>.
    To spread some magical fuzzy winter feelings, I want to share some
    thoughts about what I call “belief-conditional things”. I think I’m
    on to something here.</p>

    <p>What is the relationship between belief and reality? Some like to
    think in terms of “territory and map”: the territory is everything
    <em>out there</em>. The map is a lossy <em>mental</em>
    representation of the territory. We know that the <a

    is not the territory</a>; sometimes, we are <a

    the left there’s a map, on the right there’s… Middle earth?</p>
    <p>The entire scientific endeavor might be summarized as reducing
    discrepancies between map and territory. Traditionally, you would
    update the map according to what you see in the environment.</p>

    Seeing that there is no dragon in your garage and giving up on the

    <p>But if your metric is symmetric (and why would you call it a <a

    otherwise?) then it’s equally effective to change the territory.</p>

    Believing in the dragon so hard that reality changes to match your

    <p>Indeed, I think this is what motivates a substantial part of
    moral philosophy<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/belief-conditional-things-things#footnote-2-41815715">2</a>:
    Instead of accepting the world as it is, we conjure our ideas about
    how things ought to be into reality. Thus, it’s not unheard of that
    reality is affected by our beliefs. This opens the door for…</p>
    <h2 id="gödels-trick"><strong>Gödel’s trick</strong></h2>
    <p>When thinking about existence and belief, it is natural to think
    of <a
    href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-epistemic">epistemic
    logic</a> - the subfield of the philosophy of knowledge that
    formalizes how we form and maintain beliefs. This approach allows us
    to derive, under reasonable axioms, that <a

    and knowledge collapse</a>. Formally, this means that believing in

    <p>Any good rationalist might now counter: “Well, yes, belief might
    imply existence. But you don’t actually believe in
    <strong>X</strong>. You only <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CqyJzDZWvGhhFJ7dY/belief-in-belief">believe
    that you believe</a> in <strong>X</strong>.” The classic example is
    the “<a
    href="http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/110/Sagan.pdf">dragon
    in the garage</a>” of Carl Sagan:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“A fire-breathing dragon lives in my garage”<br />
    Suppose I seriously make such an assertion to you. Surely you’d want
    to check it out, see for yourself. There have been innumerable
    stories of dragons over the centuries, but no real evidence. What an
    opportunity!<br />
    “Show me,” you say.<br />
    I lead you to my garage. You look inside and see a ladder, empty
    paint cans, an old tricycle — but no dragon.<br />
    “Where’s the dragon?” you ask.<br />
    “Oh, she’s right here,” I reply, waving vaguely.<br />
    “I neglected to mention that she’s an invisible dragon.”<br />
    You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture
    the dragon’s footprints.<br />
    “Good idea,” I say, “but this dragon floats in the air.”<br />
    Then you’ll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible
    fire.<br />
    “Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless.”<br />
    You’ll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.<br />
    “Good idea, but she’s an incorporeal dragon and the paint won’t
    stick.”<br />
    And so on. I counter every physical test you propose with a special
    explanation of why it won’t work.</p>
    </blockquote>

    a cool dragon 🤩</p>
    <p>Carl Sagan argues that the person claiming a dragon in their
    garage doesn’t <em>actually</em> believe this. Their ability to <a
    href="http://strategicreasoning.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pami93.pdf">explain
    away</a> (ahead of time) all contradicting experimental evidence
    reveals that they accurately model the territory. They know exactly
    what to expect, given that there is no dragon in the garage. They
    might claim to believe <strong>X</strong> , but they only believe
    that they believe <strong>X</strong>.</p>
    <p>But for Gödel’s trick to work, we <em>actually</em> need to
    believe <strong>X</strong>. Thus we have to stick our necks out and
    make falsifiable predictions. Saying, “Come to my garage and see the
    dragon. She’s really cool!” is not the hard part. The hard part is
    <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences">paying
    rent</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="trolling-your-landlord."><strong>Trolling your
    landlord.</strong></h2>
    <p>“Paying rent” in this context comes from the rationalist strategy
    of “<a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences">making
    your beliefs pay rent</a>”. Beliefs are only allowed to stay in your
    head if they “pay” by making predictions about the world. If those
    predictions cash out, the belief is allowed to stay. If not, they
    will be kicked out. If you continuously claim that there is a dragon
    in your garage, and you make predictions accordingly, eventually the
    belief won’t be able to pay anymore. Then you won’t be able to use
    Gödel’s trick.</p>
    <p>But what is the “money” here? What is used to pay the rent? And
    what determines how much “money” the belief has?</p>
    <p>In a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability">Bayesian
    framework</a>,<a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X03001506">beliefs
    are akin to probabilities</a> and have a number between zero and one
    <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credence_%28statistics%29">associated
    with them</a>, indicating how strong the belief is. Changes these
    numbers in a systematic way (that incorporates all the evidence
    optimally) is called <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XTXWPQSEgoMkAupKt/an-intuitive-explanation-of-bayes-s-theorem">Bayesian
    belief updates</a>. On the road to believing <strong>X</strong> into
    existence, you might suffer severe setbacks. If you naively follow
    Bayes, these setbacks will reduce your belief until you end up not
    believing in the <em>belief-conditional thing</em>
    <strong>X</strong> - thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
    <p>Luckily, we are now in the territory of mathematics, a field
    known to be highly susceptible to shenanigans. Most <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037518c/all-mathematicians-are-trollable-divergence-of-naturalistic-logical-updates">mathematicians
    are trollable</a><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/belief-conditional-things-things#footnote-5-41815715">5</a>.
    It turns out that any Bayesian hit to our belief in
    <strong>X</strong> through new evidence can be counteracted by
    thinking about ways that <strong>X</strong> might be true after all.
    In particular, any sentence <strong>A - &gt; X</strong> that you can
    prove (like <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_film">“Santa Claus exists
    and used to be a reclusive toymaker in the Far North”</a> therefore
    “Santa Claus exists”<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/belief-conditional-things-things#footnote-6-41815715">6</a>)
    eliminates probability mass of <strong>not X</strong>. Repeated
    sufficiently many times, this procedure should allow us to believe
    in <strong>X</strong> sufficiently strong to believe
    <strong>X</strong> into existence - again, a self-fulfilling
    prophecy. Dreaming about <strong>X</strong> and picturing it with as
    many details as possible is thus a necessary step for making it
    real.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4efbda1a-2e16-4028-a9d8-0bb8cafc6653_256x256.png"><img

    very formal troll.</p>
    <p>Thus, through several loops and twists, we arrive at what every
    child can already tell you: Making belief-conditional-things exists
    only requires us to believe strongly, picture the thing in as many
    details as possible, and act as if it really can exist. Easy as
    that.</p>
    <h2 id="closing-thoughts."><strong>Closing thoughts.</strong></h2>
    <p>Through the examples I have listed in the first section, I might
    have deceived you into exclusively thinking about fantastic and
    mystical creatures. But those are (by far) not the only examples of
    things that can only exist when we believe in them. <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0agVZwux1Hs">Mars
    colonies</a>, <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">curing
    cancer</a>, and peace on earth are additional examples - in fact,
    most good things in the future are belief-conditional. Following the
    argument outlined above, we can believe belief-conditional thing
    <strong>X</strong> into existence by doing the following things: By
    changing the territory rather than our map, by providing as many
    viable avenues to achieve <strong>X</strong> as possible, and by
    sticking our necks out to perform tests while actually believing in
    the possibility of <strong>X</strong>. There might be more things we
    can do, and most of the ones I list might not apply in all
