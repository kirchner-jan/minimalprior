With this sequence, we (Sam + Jan) want to provide a principled derivation of the [natural abstractions hypothesis](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Nwgdq6kHke5LY692J/alignment-by-default#Unsupervised__Natural_Abstractions) (which we will introduce in-depth in later posts) by motivating it with insights from computational neuroscience.

You can find the intro post to the sequence over at [Samâ€™s Newsletter](https://snellessen.substack.com/p/introduction-to-hebbian-natural-abstractions).
