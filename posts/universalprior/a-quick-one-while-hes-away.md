## [A quick update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJv2-_--EY4&ab_channel=TheWhoVEVO)

My earliest best friend from school is named Jan. Later in high school, three out of four people in my group of closest friends were also called Jan. In university, I had three flatmates whose name was, I kid you not, also Jan[^1]. We all had middle names that we used to differentiate ourselves, so throughout my childhood and teenage years, I was always called Jan _Hendrik_. It was very weird for me when I moved further south and people called me _just_ Jan because there were no other Jans around. I almost felt [like I was missing something](https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/25#:~:text=\(Back%20in%20the%20old%20days%2C%20whenever%20magical%20identical%20twins%20were%20born%2C%20it%20had%20been%20the%20custom%20to%20kill%20one%20of%20them%20after%20birth.\)).

Why am I bringing this up? No particular reason.

Let's put the punchline first: A few weeks ago, I joined the [Alignment Team](https://openai.com/alignment/) at OpenAI! ðŸŽ‰ Everything is super exciting, and everybody is super nice to me! I'm working remotely now, but I hope to move to the bay area soon. Moving to the bay [appears to be a very hip thing among EAs](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M5GoKkWtBKEGMCFHn/what-s-the-theory-of-change-of-come-to-the-bay-over-the), so Iâ€™m looking forward to meeting as many interesting people as possible.

I have a great story to tell about how this new job came about, involving me teaching myself how to code in the hope of building an AI, reading about the [AI box experiment](https://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox), and studying brains to understand how cognition comes about. But I'm not a big fan of personal mythologies[^2], so I'll admit that I simply got seduced[^3] by one of the most interesting[^4] problems out there. And Iâ€™m pretty happy about getting to work on that full-time.

My new job is also why I've been uncharacteristically quiet for the last two weeks on this Substack. The problem is not that I am "too busy to write". I have [previously professed my belief](https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/slightly-advanced-decision-theory?s=w) that I want to do _**all the things**_ to maximize positive impact[^5]. I havenâ€™t changed my mind about that; the problem is that there is currently a lot of "renovation" going on in my head. I'm moving a lot of neuroscience knowledge from working memory to my cerebral basement, and I'm doing a _lot_ of updates on all kinds of beliefs. I _am_ working on some more posts, and I have more collaborations in the pipeline, but I'm running out of swap space very fast[^6].

So, _Iâ€™ll be back,_ etc etc[^7]! The [IAN](https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/making-of-ian)niversary is coming up, I want to write some retrospective on my PhD, and there is a post on Hebbian learning and the covariance rule that feels relevant for [modularity](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JzTfKrgC7Lfz3zcwM/theories-of-modularity-in-the-biological-literature). Iâ€™m [not ready to stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6IBDpYr8aw&ab_channel=GildasSaynac).

Oh, and I've always wanted to say this, but it never made sense before. But now I can. Ahem: _The views expressed on this blog are my own and do not represent the views of my employer._ Wow, that felt good.

[^1]:(The name was insanely popular in Northern Germany around the time I was born.)

[^2]:The stories we tell ourselves about why we do what we do are probably largely just that - stories.

[^3]:or, less Romantically, [nerd-sniped](https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/elementary-infra-bayesianism?s=w)

[^4]:and (possibly/maybe?) important

[^5]:And the one way I feel comfortable claiming similarities between Scott Alexander and me is when [he describes how he ](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/#:~:text=fool%20me.-,Just,-as%20drugs%20mysteriously)_[cannot](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/#:~:text=fool%20me.-,Just,-as%20drugs%20mysteriously)_[ stop](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/#:~:text=fool%20me.-,Just,-as%20drugs%20mysteriously).

[^6]:Now I realize that the previous paragraph _is_ just a roundabout way of saying, "I'm too busy to write "... Oh well ðŸ˜„ I _am_ optimistic about returning to my previous schedule.

[^7]:(I realize that I might want to go easy on the [Terminator references](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02704) in the future.)
