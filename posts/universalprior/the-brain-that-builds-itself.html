    <h1 id="constraints-make-creative"><strong>Constraints make
    creative</strong></h1>
    <p>Originally, my motivation for getting into neuroscience was: ”
    <em>Building artificial intelligence is difficult, so perhaps I can
    learn something from looking at how the biological brain is built.
    Once I’ve figured that out, AI will be easy</em> “.</p>
    <p>(When I read these words I can’t help but add a mental “<a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YClAMYTEuZ0&amp;ab_channel=AmirTolkovsky">duuuuh</a>”.)</p>
    <p>Since those innocent days, I have come to appreciate that
    building a biological brain is a ridiculously <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">overconstrained
    problem</a>. 1. First off - <strong>even before you’re done
    building, the brain must make itself useful</strong>. And it’s not
    just “occasionally helping with an arithmetic problem” - I’m talking
    about “breathing”, “eating”, “coordinating limbs”… If the
    environment is dangerous, then also “running away” or “fighting” is
    on the menu. And you need to do these things <em>reliably</em> -
    lapsing means death. 1. Second - <strong>every neuron only has
    access to</strong> _ <strong>local</strong>_
    <strong>information</strong>. In particular, every neuron only
    receives input from a limited number of other neurons (usually &lt;
    10,000 out of ~80 billion). From that information, a neuron needs to
    infer what its role in the developing brain ought to be.
    Consequently, every solution you come up with must be “symmetric” in
    the sense that you can swap two neurons, and the end result must
    still work. (<a
    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6899440/">It
    turns out the two neurons don’t even have to be from the same
    species</a>). 1. Third - <strong>there is no clear separation
    between “the thing you’re building” and “the thing that is doing the
    building”<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-brain-that-builds-itself#footnote-1-57181673">1</a></strong>.
    <a
    href="https://generative.ink/prophecies/#:~:text=The%20message%20had%20become%20the%20medium">The
    brain is making itself</a> with only rough guidance from genes and
    the environment (see <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-mind-neuroscience?s=w">this
    post</a> I wrote on the topic a while ago).</p>
    <p>In contrast, the solution for AI appears to be (for now) “just
    stack more layers”:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe70f49fe-eeaf-41f7-b27f-1e3e96722d19_787x943.png"><img

    href="https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis">source</a></p>
    <p>In AI, “the thing being built” and “the thing that’s doing the
    building” is cleanly separated into “model” and “optimizer”. Global
    information like the learning rate is readily available to all
    units. And even <em>after</em> training, there are no predators that
    punish lack of robustness<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-brain-that-builds-itself#footnote-2-57181673">2</a>.</p>
    <p>But <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5FL9VTBZzQ&amp;ab_channel=TED-Ed">constraints
    make creative</a>, and it seems like the aforementioned constraints
    turn out to have their benefits: 1. First - An adversarial
    environment forces the brain to be robust against perturbations.
    Both <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2243">theory</a> and <a
    href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/generally-capable-agents-emerge-from-open-ended-play">practice</a>
    tell us that with robustness comes the ability to generalize to
    novel domains. (<a
    href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601428103">Intense
    adversarial dynamics</a> might, in fact, explain the <a
    href="https://arbital.com/p/agi/#:~:text=that%20distinguishes%20humans%20from%20our%20nearest%20chimpanzee%20relatives">huge
    gap between monkeys and humans in terms of generality</a>.) 1.
    Second - A neat consequence of locality is <em>modularity</em>. When
    you try to use as little “wire” as possible to connect your neurons,
    <a
    href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.2863">locally
    interconnected modules tend to emerge</a>. Beyond making things <a

    more interpretable</a>, <a

    can also increase some types of robustness</a>. 1. Third - … This
    one beats me.</p>
    <p>What is the benefit of having to build yourself? I’m not sure.
    Let’s zoom in on that.</p>
    <h1 id="bootstrapping-brains"><strong>Bootstrapping
    brains</strong></h1>
    <p>What does it mean for the brain to be building itself?</p>
    <p>As the brain is growing, it is <em>dynamically</em> responding to
    cues. Removing input to one eye and the visual cortex balances the
    loss by <a
    href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1918368117">upregulating
    input from the other</a>. <em>Adding</em> an additional eye results
    in… well, this:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9310899d-948d-4864-8fe8-93fe8df7a4d6_191x220.png"><img

    Science editors couldn’t resist and tagged this as “<a
    href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.308.5724.948a">Cultivating
    the Third Eye</a>”</p>
    <p>When the brain does this type of rearranging, it is both the
    thing that “notices” that something is wrong, and it’s also the
    thing that “is being modified”.</p>
    <p>Third-eye shenanigans are only one (illustrative) example of the
    dynamic nature of development. Throughout development, immature
    neural <strong>circuits</strong> produce <strong>activity</strong>
    that induces activity-dependent formation/removal of synapses, which
    changes the <strong>circuit</strong> , which leads to changed
    <strong>activity</strong> , … <strong>The circuit is “the thing
    you’re building,” and its activity is “the thing that is doing the
    building”</strong>.</p>

    <p>I’ve briefly <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-mind-neuroscience?s=w">written
    about this dynamic</a> before, but now I want to take a deeper dive
    because a thing I’ve been working on with colleagues for a while is
    <a
    href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.493217v1">finally
    out as a preprint</a>.</p>
    <p>Let’s start by building some intuition by looking at pretty
    pictures. We start with one of my favorite recordings of the optic
    tectum of a zebrafish developing over 16 hours:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f7fae16-1320-48d4-a777-071a83fc9d57_512x367.gif"><img

    <p>After soaking in this beauty for a bit, I would like to ask you
    to look closely at some of the tiny protrusions. You’ll notice that
    the smaller protrusions tend to probe the environment a bit before
    settling for a direction to grow in.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1191">Niell and
    colleagues</a> made that observation eight years earlier, but their
    camera wasn’t as nice.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a467dc3-6403-4251-be6d-1e8017de693e_512x433.gif"><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a467dc3-6403-4251-be6d-1e8017de693e_512x433.gif" /></a></p>
    <p>On the plus side, they got a very close look at an individual
    dendritic tree of a neuron in the optic tectum. And importantly,
    they genetically manipulated the fish so that its synapses glow
    green. So they were able to look closely at the interactions between
    dendrite growth and synapse formation.</p>
    <p>Now, this is where the plot thickens. Synapses are the site of
    transmission of electric nerve impulses between two nerve cells, so
    synapses live at the intersection of the <strong>circuit</strong>
    (defined by the locations of synapses) and its
    <strong>activity</strong> (the signal transmitted by the synapse).
    Therefore, we might expect that the dynamics of synapse development
    should be pretty important.</p>
    <p>And that’s indeed the conclusion that Niell and colleagues arrive
    at. They look very closely at a developing branch, and they notice
    that once a synapse (a green blob) forms, the developing dendrite
    tends to <em>anchor</em> to that synapse. So it seems that during
    early development, the initial synapses a dendrite makes can act as
    a type of <em>scaffold</em>.</p>
    <p><a

    <h1 id="probably-prunable"><strong>Probably prunable</strong></h1>
    <p>But not all development is about growth! Rather, it’s about
    growth plus <strong>selective pruning</strong>. I’ve <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/a-brief-excursion-into-molecular?s=w">written</a>
    about a potential molecular mechanism underlying this dynamic
    before, and now we’ll see it in action.</p>
    <p>Right out the gate - even though there can be a lot of pruning,
    this typically doesn’t mean that the dendrite gets <em>shorter</em>
    in total<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-brain-that-builds-itself#footnote-3-57181673">3</a>.
    Typically, retractions of branches are balanced by the addition of
    new branches. Here are pictures from a timelapse from a Xenopus
    tadpole neuron:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0af0cd7-5d2c-4671-8b1e-fee96eb5b87c_678x414.png"><img

    bottom row shows branches that will be lost by the end of the
    recording in red, branches that appear and disappear throughout the
    recording in green, and branches that emerge and are stable until
    the end of the recording in yellow. Importantly, despite all the
    local changes, the overall length of the dendrite remains
    approximately the same.</p>
    <p>What determines if a branch stabilizes or gets pruned? It’s kind
    of unclear - but let’s collect the evidence. 1. First, here’s a
    sequence of pictures from the retina of a baby chicken. The pictures
    show a dendrite in the baseline (left), when activity is blocked
    (middle), and when activity is allowed again.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08693e62-c1ae-499a-a9d9-d7823f86cb08_605x188.png"><img

    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature00850#Fig3">source</a></p>
    <p>The dendrite retracts rapidly when the activity stops and then
    extends again when the activity resumes. So <strong>dendrite
    retraction can be triggered by activity-dependent
    mechanisms</strong>. 1. Second, here’s a dendrite in the optic
    tectum of the Xenopus tadpole. The tadpole is trained with a visual
    stimulus, and the dendrite shows new protrusions that form in
    response to the training. Importantly, these protrusions are
    responsive to the stimulus that the tadpole was trained with.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa993119c-0e6d-4542-a94a-eea344e1d160_1600x833.png"><img

    <p>So <strong>specific activity can trigger the growth of
    dendrites</strong>. 1. Third, the “<a

    and Moriarty of molecular neuroscience</a>” also get a starring role
    in this story. <a

    that synapses that fire “out-of-sync” tend to “lose their link”. Or,
    in less poetic terms, <strong>nearby synapses tend to
    compete</strong>.</p>

    <h1 id="computerization"><strong>Computerization</strong></h1>
    <p>Those were the puzzle pieces we knew about (or <a

    when we started the project. It seemed plausible that synapse
    formation and removal might have a pretty big impact on what the
    dendrite looks like. And in particular, whether a synapse stabilizes
    or not might be determined by whether it fires in synchrony with its
    neighbors.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.493217v1.full">When
    we put these ideas into a model</a>, we get something like the
    following video:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03cb97a4-1a6e-4db7-b771-473b13bf7476_512x404.gif"><img

    <p>Initially, the dendrites shoot outwards and search for synaptic
    connections (synapses not shown in the video). Initially, the
    dendrite is not picky at all - it just connects with any potential
    partner it finds. This results in a rapid increase in total length
    that nicely mirrors the increase in length observed in biology
    (again from a <a
    href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198745273.001.0001/acprof-9780198745273-chapter-3">Xenopus

    <p>However, now something interesting happens both in the model and
    in biology; dendrite growth tapers off and stabilizes!</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e036dc4-09d7-4186-ba30-3d6a9dd7358d_938x556.png"><img

    <p>As I’ve shown you before, this stability in total length does not
    mean that there is no change in the dendrite structure anymore;
    rather, the addition and removal of branches are balanced in a
    <strong>fixed point</strong> /steady state. This is also something
    we observe in the model:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda185735-0b9f-491d-91cf-37579ff16f02_490x464.png"><img

    <p>But why is it that the dendrite “suddenly” stops growing? The
    answer is unclear from the biological data, but our model gives a
    neat explanation: Dendrite growth stops because competition between
    synapses is starting!</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda615d37-c9a9-416c-ade5-2ef92d143fee_426x394.png"><img

    <p>Due to the dynamics of the competition, it took a while for
    synapses to “get to know their neighbors” and decide whether they
    were well-synchronized. But once they figured it out, synaptic
    pruning starts, and the dendrite cannot simply add new synapses at
    random anymore. Thus, growth slows down, and many poorly
    synchronized synapses get removed. What remains are only
    well-synchronized synapses:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff615c226-4779-456c-9d0c-113e730b322f_744x1438.png"><img

    of a synapse here indicates the type of activity that the synapse
    receives. Same color means that the synapses fire in synchrony,
    different color means they fire out of sync.</p>
    <p>This way, our model can link the development of dendrites and the
    emergence of synaptic organization in one framework.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.493217v1">In
    the paper</a>, we push things further and show how our model fits in
    with more experiments and how the resulting dendrites have some cool
    optimality properties that emerge from a simple synapse-centric
    growth rule. But for this post, it’s time to wrap things up and to
    return to our original question: How can the brain be, at the same
    time, “the thing you’re building” and “the thing that is doing the
    building”? And could this be good for anything?</p>
    <h1 id="closing-thoughts"><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h1>
    <p>I feel the strong urge to do a bunch of epistemic hedging,
    “theory is theory and experiment is experiment,” and “I could be
    totally wrong about this”, but I think that’s <a
    href="https://nassimtaleb.org/2016/09/intellectual-yet-idiot/">pretty
    bad style</a>. Instead, I’ll say that this is my current best guess,
    and if I’m wrong I’ll be appropriately surprised and
    embarrassed.</p>
    <p>Instead of doing more hedging, I’ll stick my neck out even
    further and talk about “<a

    <strong>Schematic</strong> <strong>of “the delta” added by a
    (typical) academic paper.</strong> Papers you have read before are
    shown in the background with an orange background. Relationships
    between papers are indicated with double-sided arrows. The size and
    shape of the orange background represent the statements you believe
    are likely to be true. The newly added paper is shown in the
    foreground on a blue background. The portion that the new paper
    makes likely to be true (or, sometimes, demonstrates to be true) is
    “the delta”.</p>
    <p>What do I believe now about “the brain that builds itself”? 1. A
    straightforward way to obtain structured connectivity in a neural
    circuit is to start with a <em><a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy</a></em><a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">strategy</a>
    (connect as many things as possible), followed by an
    <strong>autoregressive<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-brain-that-builds-itself#footnote-4-57181673">4</a>
    learning rule that amplifies structure and prunes away the
    noise</strong>. 1. Through successive amplification of structure and
    pruning of noise, <strong>the developmental process converges to a
    fixed point</strong> , defined as the point where the learning rule
    produces no more competition.</p>
    <p>The “benefit” of this dynamical systems solution is (again)
    “robustness”. As long as you make sure your learning rule keeps on
    doing its thing it doesn’t matter if you get small perturbations.
    You’ll keep rolling towards the valley of attraction anyways.</p>
    <p>Sticking my neck out even further, I can’t help but think of the
    <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cy3BhHrGinZCp3LXE/testing-the-natural-abstraction-hypothesis-project-intro">natural
    abstraction hypothesis</a> here. Perhaps a lot of the cognitive
    structure that humans have does <em>not</em> actually require a lot
    of specification during development. Perhaps the fixed point of the
    developmental process is “natural” in the sense that any
    autoregressive learner with sensory input from the world<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-brain-that-builds-itself#footnote-5-57181673">5</a>
    (and with approximately similar computational capacity) will end up
    with approximately the same cognitive structure.</p>
    <p>This moves the question from the world of neuroscience into the
    world of… the world? What is the world out there like, and why does
    it have so much structure? I’ll think about it a bit and update you
    on my progress ;)</p>

    <p>This image floating around the internet gets used <em>all over
    the place</em> to argue that there is something special happening in
    the brain of humans around the age of 5-6. The image comes
    originally from <a
    href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.156.2.168">Seeman,
    1999</a>:</p>

    <p>It might well be that something special happens at that age, but
    I cannot find a single other study that replicates the image on the
    left. In fact, a pretty <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2018.1#Abs1">credible
    Nature Review shows</a> an increasing complexity up to age 24.</p>

    <p>Also, note that the caption of the Seeman figure talks about a
    decline in synaptic connections, which are not even visible on the
    left. And the right shows a decline in dopamine receptors, but with
    a very suspicious x-axis and very few data points in the most
    critical period.</p>
