      <h4 id="code-first-ask-questions-later">Code first, ask questions
      later</h4>
      <p>In <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-scaling-academia">On
      Scaling Academia</a> I made the case that <em>automatic
      research</em> , i.e. AI-supported &amp; scalable application of
      the <a
      href="https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/8#:~:text=science%20investigation%20project%3A-,Step,-1%3A%20Form%20a">scientific
      method</a>, might be great. My argument went like this,</p>
      <ol class="incremental" type="1">
      <li>automatic research is beneficial for academia (systematization
      and <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/gamble.html">objective
      metrics of progress</a> are woefully lacking in current
      academia),</li>
      <li>some degree of automation might be strictly necessary for
      continued scientific progress (note the ever-increasing <a
      href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">unwieldiness of
      humanity’s collected knowledge</a>).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, many things “might be great”<sup>[1]</sup>, but most
      aren’t <a
      href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/itn-framework-1">tractable</a>.
      Does <em>automatic research</em> fall into that category? It’s
      tempting to <a
      href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0494-4">tackle
      that question from the metaphorical ivory tower</a> and to get
      lost in definitions and speculation. That’s not my comparative
      advantage<sup>[2]</sup>, I prefer getting excited and building
      things. In this spirit, I’ll “code first, ask questions later”.
      Instead of doing all of research at once, I focus on a central
      aspect of research, <em>idea generation</em> , and present some of
      my initial experiments and experiences with automating idea
      generation.</p>

      <h4 id="using-ian-to-generate-all-the-proto-ideas"><strong>Using
      IAN to generate all the (proto-)ideas</strong></h4>
      <p>The first insight is that having ideas is <em>really easy</em>.
      The problem is having <em>good</em> ideas<sup>[3]</sup>. When you
      feel like you can’t come up with any ideas, you probably can’t see
      the forest for the trees. Generating ideas is a combinatoric
      process: take two things (or more), combine them, and, voilà, <a
      href="https://screenrant.com/bojack-horseman-todd-popular-dumb-ideas-reddit/">Clown
      Dentists, West Dakota, and Halloween in January</a><sup>[4]</sup>.
      People working on computational creativity <a
      href="https://www.creativitypost.com/article/systematizing-creativity-a-computational-view">call
      this “pastiche”</a> and distinguish it from “real creativity”. But
      let us not be deterred by that, we’ll start philosophizing once
      we’re done coding. Perhaps we will see a path forward once we know
      how to generate pastiche at scale.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[4] </p>
      <p>Taking a list of ideas from some of the funniest writers is
      probably not the best way to make this point. However, the ideas
      that I come up with (combined keyboard &amp; mouse, banana
      telephone, microphone shoes) are so lame, they are making my point
      <em>too</em> well.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[3] </p>
      <p>I think this distinction is the easiest way to resolve the
      tension between Stephen Malina et al. <a
      href="https://guzey.com/ideas-not-mattering-is-a-psyop/#:~:text=don%E2%80%99t%20buy%20it.-,Empirically%2C%20all%20our%20aspiring%20founder%20friends%20are%20desperate%20for%20startup%20ideas%2C%20with%20few%20managing%20to%20land%20on%20something%20worthwhile%2C%20and%20all%20our%20scientist%20friends%20are%20desperate%20for%20research%20ideas.,-Good%20ideas%20are">writing<br />
      </a>” <em>Empirically, all our aspiring founder friends are
      desperate for startup ideas, with few managing to land on
      something worthwhile, and all our scientist friends are desperate
      for research ideas.</em> ”<br />
      and me <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-scaling-academia#:~:text=I%20could%20come%20up%20with%20a%20research%20program%20that%20keeps%201000s%20of%20people%20busy">writing<br />
      </a>” <em>I could come up with a research program that keeps 1000s
      of people busy.</em> ”<br />
      I totally could keep them <em>busy</em>. I’m much less certain if
      I could get them to do anything <em>useful</em>.</p>
      </div>
      <p>“Pastiche at scale” happens to be one of the many nicknames of
      <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/making-of-ian">IAN</a>,
      a large language model fine-tuned of my personal notes and the
      papers that I read. Given a prompt, IAN will produce multiple
      possible continuations, kind of like the “autocomplete” feature on
      smartphones only more so. Prompting IAN with</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when
      published</p>
      <pre><code> _Here is a list of interesting project ideas:

      </blockquote>
      <p>produces pastiche gems like</p>
      <blockquote>

      published</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>And a <em>lot</em> more. Making IAN generate pastiche for 24
      hours results in ~10,000 “proto-ideas”. I call them proto-ideas
      because quality varies a lot<sup>[5]</sup>; sifting through all of
      them is more work than coming up with proper ideas myself. This
      leads us directly to the next step.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">

      </div>
      <h4 id="turning-proto-ideas-into-ideas"><strong>Turning
      proto-ideas into ideas</strong></h4>
      <p>The second insight is that distinguishing nonsense from ideas
      is <em>easy</em>. I can tell if a proto-idea is nonsense in less
      than a second, which is <a
      href="https://second.wiki/wiki/100-schritt-regel">usually a good
      indicator</a> that the process can be automated. The solution that
      I came up with is a logistic regression model on a <a
      href="https://www.sbert.net/">semantic embedding</a> of the
      proto-idea, that is trained <a
      href="https://github.com/online-ml/river">online</a> through an
      interface I <a href="https://streamlit.io/">threw
      together</a>:</p>
      <p>This video shows the interface after I’ve trained it for a few
      hundred examples, and the “predicted usefulness” (0=nonsense,
      1=idea) has already converged pretty well. In fact, when I map the
      proto-ideas <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">into a
      low-dimensional space</a>, we can see a bit of organization
      emerge.</p>
      <p><img
      src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_178.png" />tSNE
      projection of semantic embedding of proto-ideas. Color indicates
      usefulness of proto-ideas as predicted by logistic regression
      model.</p>
      <p>As you can see, the regression has learned that ideas from the
      neuroscience peninsula tend to be the most useful for
      me<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[6] </p>
      <p>Learning this is not too hard, a fuzzy keyword would probably
      also work.</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when

      </blockquote>
      <p>But also in other regions of semantic space, there are ideas
      with high predicted usefulness. Here is a selection:</p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>The Tale Of Gandhi was <em>always</em> supposed to be a
      series.</p>
      </div>
      </blockquote>
      <h4 id="ideas-and-great-ideas"><strong>Ideas and “great”
      ideas</strong></h4>
      <p>The third insight is that the quality of an idea is not an
      <em>intrinsic</em> , but an <em>extrinsic</em> property. The
      quality does not sit within the idea, it is determined by us from
      the outside. And these judgments are subjective<sup>[8]</sup>, so
      there is no universal way to generate <em>great</em> ideas.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[8] </p>
      <p>“Getting a tattoo”, “Becoming an actor”, “Starting a stamp
      collection”, “Investing in cryptocurrency”, are all either great
      or terrible ideas depending on what you value.</p>
      </div>
      <p>However, once you <em>do</em> know which criteria you care for,
      identifying a <em>great</em> idea reduces to a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">constraint
      satisfaction problem</a>; and we have <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier">great</a>
      <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin%27s_maximum_principle">tools</a>
      for solving those. In the simplest form<sup>[9]</sup> we don’t
      even have to resort to anything fancier than <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/soldiers-scouts-and-albatrosses">search</a>.
      The algorithm looks something like this:</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[9] </p>
      <p>If all the constraints are just binary “satisfied” or “not
      satisfied” constraint.</p>
      </div>
      <pre><code>while not found:
  idea = next_idea()
  if constraints(idea):
    return idea</code></pre>
      <p>I’ve implemented this with a <a
      href="https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html">semantic
      search</a>, followed by a ranking according to usefulness
      predicted by the regression<sup>[10]</sup>.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[10] </p>
      <p>I can imagine straightforward extensions of this where I layer
      <a
      href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/boolean-search/">Boolean
      search</a> on top of the output of multiple semantic search
      queries, but probably there is a more elegant way to implement
      this directly on the semantic embedding.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The <em>actual</em> constraints arising in a research project
      are substantially more complicated than just semantic
      similarity<sup>[11]</sup>, but the central logic of this approach
      remains unchanged: generate a <em>lot</em> of ideas and filter.
      The comparative advantage of computers is that they can do a
      simple thing much faster and much longer than a human can;
      generating a ginormous dataset of proto-ideas is not feasible for
      humans, but “easy”<sup>[12]</sup> for computers. This is
      essentially the same strategy that led to <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_%28chess_computer%29">superhuman
      chess performance</a> and that only now, after decades, is
      supplanted by <a

      </div>
      <h4 id="going-from-great-ideas-to-implementations"><strong>Going
      from great ideas to implementations</strong></h4>
      <p>The fourth insight is that while the greatness of ideas is
      subjective, the greatness of <em>implementations</em> is more
      objective. You can argue whether some of the “great” ideas I
      listed above are actually great, but once there is an
      implementation the nature of an argument changes qualitatively.
      Once implemented, reality enters the discussion and
      adjudicates.</p>
      <p>I want to write an entire post on how to automate going from
      idea to implementation, but here is the minimalist workflow that
      I’m using for now:</p>
      <ol class="incremental" type="1">
      <li>Set a time frame based on previous experience from similar
      projects, <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CPm5LTwHrvBJCa9h5/planning-fallacy">not
      based on particulars of the current project</a>.</li>
      <li>Divide the time <strong>evenly</strong><sup>[13]</sup> into an
      “expansion” and a “contraction” phase<sup>[14]</sup>.
      <ol class="incremental" type="1">
      <li>In the expansion phase, iterate the following steps: Collect
      information (reading reviews and using <a
      href="https://roamresearch.com/elicit.org">Elicit</a>), <a
      href="https://roamresearch.com/">chart</a> people and beliefs (in
      my experience, authorship explains most variability), <a
      href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/">implement
      prototypes</a> (<a
      href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1441027241870118913.html">build
      the smallest toy example that would invalidate an idea</a>),
      explore implications and reject dead ends (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio
      ad absurdum</a>).</li>
      <li>In the contraction phase, do the following: Don’t implement
      anything new (<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_%28software_engineering%29">feature
      freeze</a>), identify the “solid core” (throw away
      <em>everything</em> that is not fully cooked <sup>[15]</sup>),
      start writing early (writing forces you to put things in order),
      make illustrations (drawing things reveals how you
      <em>actually</em> think about something), and collect feedback (<a
      href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> improves text
      beyond just fixing typos).</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Publish whatever you have at the end of your time frame.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">fantastic
      tools</a> for some of these steps, and for the rest, I have ideas
      for how to build the necessary tools. I’ll keep you posted on how
      this goes.</p>
      <h4 id="closing-thoughts"><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h4>
      <p>According to “code first, think later” we’ve now reached the
      “think” part. You can probably tell that I am skeptical of people
      who <a
      href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90339590/3-reasons-why-ai-will-never-match-human-creativity">declare</a>
      that <a
      href="https://thenextweb.com/news/ai-is-incredibly-smart-but-it-will-never-match-human-creativity">creativity</a>
      is <a
      href="https://www.aceyus.com/blog/why-ai-will-never-match-human-creativity/">uniquely</a>
      human. These voices are less numerous now that AI-generated <a
      href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3">poetry</a>, <a
      href="https://www.wombo.art/">art-on-demand</a>, and <a
      href="https://www.aisongcontest.com/">music</a> are actually
      enjoyable<sup>[16]</sup>. Perhaps there is still a way of <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb/p/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE">drawing
      concept boundaries</a> that make creativity uniquely human, but
      I’m skeptical that those concepts will end up being very
      useful.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[16] </p>
      <p>With rather primitive technology, compared to what is
      possible.</p>
      </div>
      <p>I believe there is substantial confusion about where ideas come
      from. <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">WikiHow</a>
      provides a representative answer to the question “<a
      href="https://www.wikihow.com/Come-Up-With-Ideas">How to Come Up

      process:</p>
      <ol class="incremental" type="1">
      <li><em>Getting Your Brain Moving</em> , i.e. engage with the

      <p>Step two, the “gestation period” <em>appears</em> magical.
      Mathematicians <a

      <blockquote>
      <p>_How does mathematical creativity take place? Where do good
      ideas come from? Of course there is no single answer, and as we
      all get older we wonder more and more why we don’t have all the
      great ideas that we had thirty years ago.</p>
      <p>There is general agreement, however, that one of the best ways
      to think about a problem is not to think about it. That is to say,
      you work hard and concentrate all your effort on the task for a
      protracted period of time; but then you let it go. Do something
      else: mow the lawn, go for a walk, take a shower, have a shave.
      The mind still percolates away, trying some things, discarding
      others. Often it happens that the solution to the problem will
      then just pop up unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>Ron Graham, late of Bell Labs and now a Distinguished Professor
      at U.C. San Diego, gets some of his best ideas while juggling or
      performing gymnastics. Persi Diaconis (1945- ) of Stanford lets
      his ideas gestate while he is creating and performing new magic
      tricks. Henri Poincare used to go on trips to the seashore. Isaac
      Newton worked in his garden. […]_</p>

      <p>I see the value of a healthy balance as much as the next
      person, <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bx3gkHJehRCYZAF3r/pain-is-not-the-unit-of-effort">pain
      is not the unit of effort</a>. In fact, I believe that maintaining
      some balance between intense work and leisure is critical for
      sustained high research output. I still have a hard time believing
      that we will have to teach computers how to juggle as a
      <em>necessary</em> component of the creative process. And also in
      humans, creativity does not <em>always</em> require a gestation
      period. A good brainstorming session, or just thinking for <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FHiM34PmrN224pqTz/on-creativity-the-joys-of-5-minute-timers">five
      minutes by the clock about a problem</a>, can solve a substantial
      portion of problems.</p>
      <p>Instead of postulating <a
      href="https://duncanwardle.com/how-to-open-the-door-to-your-creative-genius/">something
      magical that occurs through the interaction between the
      subconscious and the conscious</a><sup>[17]</sup>, I believe there
      is a much more parsimonious explanation: What if (as argued above)
      coming up with good ideas is simply a <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/soldiers-scouts-and-albatrosses">search
      problem</a> where possible ideas are proposed, evaluated and (most
      of the time) rejected? If each proposed idea only has a small
      probability of being a “hit”, then the distribution of arrival
      times of ideas is a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process">Poisson
      process</a>, and the <a
      href="https://gtribello.github.io/mathNET/resources/jim-chap20.pdf">distribution
      of waiting times in between ideas is an exponential
      distribution</a>. As a consequence, finding a good idea simply
      takes a lot of time sometimes, especially when the probability of
      a hit is small. Having a “dry spell” of good ideas is just what we
      would (sometimes) expect under this model.</p>

      <p>Quote: <em>For most of any given day we only use our conscious
      brain, representing only a surprising 13% of the brain’s capacity.
      The other 87%, our subconscious brain goes unused because when we
      are stressed and hear ourselves say “I don’t have time to think,”
      the door between our conscious and subconscious brain closes
      completely. When this door is closed, access to all of that
      experiential and creative stimulus in the subconscious brain is
      denied, therefore, no big ideas. Every meal you’ve ever eaten,
      place you’ve ever visited, person you’ve ever met, book you’ve
      read, movie you’ve seen–they’re all back there in your
      subconscious brain waiting to make unrelated connections back to
      the challenge at hand and to support the creation of that big
      innovation.</em></p>

      <strong>a</strong> Example of a Poisson point process, blue
      circles indicate generated ideas as a function of time. Red bar
      highlights time period at beginning of simulation where no ideas
      were generated. <strong>b</strong> Distribution of waiting time
      lengths (red bar in <strong>a</strong> ) pooled across
      simulations. Notice the long tail.</p>
      <p>Disengaging from the problem then is nothing else than pressing
      the “fast forward” button. The process of searching for a good
      idea continues to “<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory">run
      in the background</a>”, perhaps with reduced
      resources<sup>[18]</sup>, and only rises to attention when a “hit”
      (or something looking a lot like a hit) was found. I suspect we
      can <a href="https://martin-thoma.com/explaining-away/">explain
      away</a> the apparent “magical” component of the creative process
      this way. But doing that is a lot less exciting than “coding away”
      the confusion, so I’ll stick to that instead.</p>
      <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[18] </p>
      <p>As long as the time spent disengaged is much longer than the
      time actively working on the problem, reduced resources do not
      matter so much.</p>

      <p>This is super important. There will be a very strong pull to
      extend the expansion phase. Don’t give in. This is the point where
      it’s decided whether you hit your deadline or not.</p>

      <p>These two phases are the ones I tried to characterize in “<a

      Scouts, and Albatrosses</a>”, although I’m not sure if I hit the

      <p>Be honest with yourself here. Again, the temptation is big to
      carry along that beautiful aspect of the project that you have
      sunken a ton of time into, but which simply doesn’t mash with
      anything else. Throw it away. (Into your drawer of “future project
      ideas” that you will never open again).</p>
