    prototype for automatic idea generation.</p>
    <h3 id="code-first-ask-questions-later">Code first, ask questions
    later</h3>
    <p>In <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-scaling-academia">On
    Scaling Academia</a> I made the case that <em>automatic
    research</em> , i.e. AI-supported &amp; scalable application of the
    <a
    href="https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/8#:~:text=science%20investigation%20project%3A-,Step,-1%3A%20Form%20a">scientific
    method</a>, might be great. My argument went like this,</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>automatic research is beneficial for academia (systematization
    and <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/gamble.html">objective
    metrics of progress</a> are woefully lacking in current
    academia),</li>
    <li>some degree of automation might be strictly necessary for
    continued scientific progress (note the ever-increasing <a
    href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">unwieldiness of
    humanity’s collected knowledge</a>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>However, many things “might be great”<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-1-45230438">1</a>,
    but most aren’t <a
    href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/itn-framework-1">tractable</a>.
    Does <em>automatic research</em> fall into that category? It’s
    tempting to <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0494-4">tackle that
    question from the metaphorical ivory tower</a> and to get lost in
    definitions and speculation. That’s not my comparative advantage<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-2-45230438">2</a>,
    I prefer getting excited and building things. In this spirit, I’ll
    “code first, ask questions later”. Instead of doing all of research
    at once, I focus on a central aspect of research, <em>idea
    generation</em> , and present some of my initial experiments and
    experiences with automating idea generation.</p>
    <h3 id="using-ian-to-generate-all-the-proto-ideas"><strong>Using IAN
    to generate all the (proto-)ideas</strong></h3>
    <p>The first insight is that having ideas is <em>really easy</em>.
    The problem is having <em>good</em> ideas<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-3-45230438">3</a>.
    When you feel like you can’t come up with any ideas, you probably
    can’t see the forest for the trees. Generating ideas is a
    combinatoric process: take two things (or more), combine them, and,
    voilà, <a
    href="https://screenrant.com/bojack-horseman-todd-popular-dumb-ideas-reddit/">Clown
    Dentists, West Dakota, and Halloween in January</a><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-4-45230438">4</a>.
    People working on computational creativity <a
    href="https://www.creativitypost.com/article/systematizing-creativity-a-computational-view">call
    this “pastiche”</a> and distinguish it from “real creativity”. But
    let us not be deterred by that, we’ll start philosophizing once
    we’re done coding. Perhaps we will see a path forward once we know
    how to generate pastiche at scale.</p>
    <p>“Pastiche at scale” happens to be one of the many nicknames of <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/making-of-ian">IAN</a>,
    a large language model fine-tuned of my personal notes and the
    papers that I read. Given a prompt, IAN will produce multiple
    possible continuations, kind of like the “autocomplete” feature on
    smartphones only more so. Prompting IAN with</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when
    published</p>
    <pre><code> _Here is a list of interesting project ideas:
1._</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>produces pastiche gems like</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when
    published</p>
    <pre><code> _I want to go to medical school_</code></pre>
    <p>Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when

    <pre><code> _A camera that takes a picture whenever it detects that someone is yawning._</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And a <em>lot</em> more. Making IAN generate pastiche for 24
    hours results in ~10,000 “proto-ideas”. I call them proto-ideas
    because quality varies a lot<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-5-45230438">5</a>;
    sifting through all of them is more work than coming up with proper
    ideas myself. This leads us directly to the next step.</p>
    <h3 id="turning-proto-ideas-into-ideas"><strong>Turning proto-ideas
    into ideas</strong></h3>
    <p>The second insight is that distinguishing nonsense from ideas is
    <em>easy</em>. I can tell if a proto-idea is nonsense in less than a
    second, which is <a
    href="https://second.wiki/wiki/100-schritt-regel">usually a good
    indicator</a> that the process can be automated. The solution that I
    came up with is a logistic regression model on a <a
    href="https://www.sbert.net/">semantic embedding</a> of the
    proto-idea, that is trained <a
    href="https://github.com/online-ml/river">online</a> through an
    interface I <a href="https://streamlit.io/">threw together</a>:</p>
    <p>This video shows the interface after I’ve trained it for a few
    hundred examples, and the “predicted usefulness” (0=nonsense,
    1=idea) has already converged pretty well. In fact, when I map the
    proto-ideas <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">into a
    low-dimensional space</a>, we can see a bit of organization
    emerge.</p>
    <p><a

    projection of semantic embedding of proto-ideas. Color indicates
    usefulness of proto-ideas as predicted by logistic regression
    model.</p>
    <p>As you can see, the regression has learned that ideas from the
    neuroscience peninsula tend to be the most useful for me<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-6-45230438">6</a>.</p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>But also in other regions of semantic space, there are ideas with
    high predicted usefulness. Here is a selection:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <em>, …</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="ideas-and-great-ideas"><strong>Ideas and “great”
    ideas</strong></h3>
    <p>The third insight is that the quality of an idea is not an
    <em>intrinsic</em> , but an <em>extrinsic</em> property. The quality
    does not sit within the idea, it is determined by us from the
    outside. And these judgments are subjective<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-8-45230438">8</a>,
    so there is no universal way to generate <em>great</em> ideas.</p>
    <p>However, once you <em>do</em> know which criteria you care for,
    identifying a <em>great</em> idea reduces to a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">constraint
    satisfaction problem</a>; and we have <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier">great</a>
    <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin%27s_maximum_principle">tools</a>
    for solving those. In the simplest form<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-9-45230438">9</a>
    we don’t even have to resort to anything fancier than <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/soldiers-scouts-and-albatrosses">search</a>.
    The algorithm looks something like this:</p>
    <pre><code>while not found:
  idea = next_idea()
  if constraints(idea):
    return idea</code></pre>
    <p>I’ve implemented this with a <a
    href="https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html">semantic
    search</a>, followed by a ranking according to usefulness predicted
    by the regression<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-10-45230438">10</a>.</p>
    <p>The <em>actual</em> constraints arising in a research project are
    substantially more complicated than just semantic similarity<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-11-45230438">11</a>,
    but the central logic of this approach remains unchanged: generate a
    <em>lot</em> of ideas and filter. The comparative advantage of
    computers is that they can do a simple thing much faster and much
    longer than a human can; generating a ginormous dataset of
    proto-ideas is not feasible for humans, but “easy”<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-12-45230438">12</a>
    for computers. This is essentially the same strategy that led to <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_%28chess_computer%29">superhuman
    chess performance</a> and that only now, after decades, is
    supplanted by <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJCLUzkn-sA&amp;ab_channel=YannicKilcher">more
    data-efficient methods</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="going-from-great-ideas-to-implementations"><strong>Going
    from great ideas to implementations</strong></h3>
    <p>The fourth insight is that while the greatness of ideas is
    subjective, the greatness of <em>implementations</em> is more
    objective. You can argue whether some of the “great” ideas I listed
    above are actually great, but once there is an implementation the
    nature of an argument changes qualitatively. Once implemented,
    reality enters the discussion and adjudicates.</p>
    <p>I want to write an entire post on how to automate going from idea
    to implementation, but here is the minimalist workflow that I’m
    using for now:</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>Set a time frame based on previous experience from similar
    projects, <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CPm5LTwHrvBJCa9h5/planning-fallacy">not
    based on particulars of the current project</a>.</li>
    <li>Divide the time <strong>evenly</strong><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-13-45230438">13</a>
    into an “expansion” and a “contraction” phase<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-14-45230438">14</a>.
    * In the expansion phase, iterate the following steps: Collect
    information (reading reviews and using <a
    href="https://roamresearch.com/elicit.org">Elicit</a>), <a
    href="https://roamresearch.com/">chart</a> people and beliefs (in my
    experience, authorship explains most variability), <a
    href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/">implement
    prototypes</a> (<a
    href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1441027241870118913.html">build
    the smallest toy example that would invalidate an idea</a>), explore
    implications and reject dead ends (<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio
    ad absurdum</a>).</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>* In the contraction phase, do the following: Don&#39;t implement anything new ([feature freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_%28software_engineering%29)), identify the &quot;solid core&quot; (throw away _everything_ that is not fully cooked[15](https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-15-45230438)), start writing early (writing forces you to put things in order), make illustrations (drawing things reveals how you _actually_ think about something), and collect feedback ([Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) improves text beyond just fixing typos).</code></pre>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>Publish whatever you have at the end of your time frame.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">fantastic tools</a>
    for some of these steps, and for the rest, I have ideas for how to
    build the necessary tools. I’ll keep you posted on how this
    goes.</p>

    <h3 id="closing-thoughts"><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h3>
    <p>According to “code first, think later” we’ve now reached the
    “think” part. You can probably tell that I am skeptical of people
    who <a
    href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90339590/3-reasons-why-ai-will-never-match-human-creativity">declare</a>
    that <a

    Perhaps there is still a way of <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SGB7Y5WERh4skwtnb/p/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE">drawing
    concept boundaries</a> that make creativity uniquely human, but I’m
    skeptical that those concepts will end up being very useful.</p>
    <p>I believe there is substantial confusion about where ideas come
    from. <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">WikiHow</a>
    provides a representative answer to the question “<a
    href="https://www.wikihow.com/Come-Up-With-Ideas">How to Come Up
    With Ideas</a>”. They recommend the following three-step
    process:</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li><em>Getting Your Brain Moving</em> , i.e. engage with the
    topic.</li>
    <li><em>Disengaging from Work</em> , i.e. allow for gestation until

    <li><em>Testing Your Ideas</em> , i.e. reject bad ideas.</li>

    have a hard time putting my feelings about these illustrations into
    words.</p>
    <p>Step two, the “gestation period” <em>appears</em> magical.

    <p>_How does mathematical creativity take place? Where do good ideas
    come from? Of course there is no single answer, and as we all get
    older we wonder more and more why we don’t have all the great ideas
    that we had thirty years ago.</p>
    <p>There is general agreement, however, that one of the best ways to
    think about a problem is not to think about it. That is to say, you
    work hard and concentrate all your effort on the task for a
    protracted period of time; but then you let it go. Do something
    else: mow the lawn, go for a walk, take a shower, have a shave. The
    mind still percolates away, trying some things, discarding others.
    Often it happens that the solution to the problem will then just pop
    up unexpectedly.</p>
    <p>Ron Graham, late of Bell Labs and now a Distinguished Professor
    at U.C. San Diego, gets some of his best ideas while juggling or
    performing gymnastics. Persi Diaconis (1945- ) of Stanford lets his
    ideas gestate while he is creating and performing new magic tricks.

    some balance between intense work and leisure is critical for
    sustained high research output. I still have a hard time believing
    that we will have to teach computers how to juggle as a
    <em>necessary</em> component of the creative process. And also in
    humans, creativity does not <em>always</em> require a gestation
    period. A good brainstorming session, or just thinking for <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FHiM34PmrN224pqTz/on-creativity-the-joys-of-5-minute-timers">five
    minutes by the clock about a problem</a>, can solve a substantial
    portion of problems.</p>
    <p>Instead of postulating <a
    href="https://duncanwardle.com/how-to-open-the-door-to-your-creative-genius/">something
    magical that occurs through the interaction between the subconscious
    and the conscious</a><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-17-45230438">17</a>,
    I believe there is a much more parsimonious explanation: What if (as
    argued above) coming up with good ideas is simply a <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/soldiers-scouts-and-albatrosses">search
    problem</a> where possible ideas are proposed, evaluated and (most
    of the time) rejected? If each proposed idea only has a small
    probability of being a “hit”, then the distribution of arrival times
    of ideas is a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process">Poisson
    process</a>, and the <a
    href="https://gtribello.github.io/mathNET/resources/jim-chap20.pdf">distribution
    of waiting times in between ideas is an exponential
    distribution</a>. As a consequence, finding a good idea simply takes
    a lot of time sometimes, especially when the probability of a hit is
    small. Having a “dry spell” of good ideas is just what we would
    (sometimes) expect under this model.</p>

    <strong>a</strong> Example of a Poisson point process, blue circles
    indicate generated ideas as a function of time. Red bar highlights
    time period at beginning of simulation where no ideas were
    generated. <strong>b</strong> Distribution of waiting time lengths
    (red bar in <strong>a</strong> ) pooled across simulations. Notice
    the long tail.</p>
    <p>Disengaging from the problem then is nothing else than pressing
    the “fast forward” button. The process of searching for a good idea
    continues to “<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory">run in
    the background</a>”, perhaps with reduced resources<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-automatic-ideas#footnote-18-45230438">18</a>,
    and only rises to attention when a “hit” (or something looking a lot
    like a hit) was found. I suspect we can <a
    href="https://martin-thoma.com/explaining-away/">explain away</a>
    the apparent “magical” component of the creative process this way.
    But doing that is a lot less exciting than “coding away” the
    confusion, so I’ll stick to that instead.</p>

    <p>Taking a list of ideas from some of the funniest writers is
    probably not the best way to make this point. However, the ideas

    <p>Be honest with yourself here. Again, the temptation is big to
    carry along that beautiful aspect of the project that you have
    sunken a ton of time into, but which simply doesn’t mash with
    anything else. Throw it away. (Into your drawer of “future project
    ideas” that you will never open again).</p>

    <p>Quote: <em>For most of any given day we only use our conscious
    brain, representing only a surprising 13% of the brain’s capacity.
    The other 87%, our subconscious brain goes unused because when we
    are stressed and hear ourselves say “I don’t have time to think,”
    the door between our conscious and subconscious brain closes
    completely. When this door is closed, access to all of that
    experiential and creative stimulus in the subconscious brain is
    denied, therefore, no big ideas. Every meal you’ve ever eaten, place
    you’ve ever visited, person you’ve ever met, book you’ve read, movie
    you’ve seen–they’re all back there in your subconscious brain
    waiting to make unrelated connections back to the challenge at hand
    and to support the creation of that big innovation.</em></p>
