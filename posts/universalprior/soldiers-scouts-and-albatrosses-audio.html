  <p>An audio version of “<a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/soldiers-scouts-and-albatrosses">Soldiers,
      Scouts, and Albatrosses</a>”. Writing long-form is fun, but
    reading a long post every week is perhaps a bit much. So now you
    can also just listen to my voice read out the posts! I plan to
    release these slightly more frequently than the written essays so
    that I catch up eventually. Also, no worries about getting flooded
    with notifications about this. For the next audio releases, I
    won’t send an email to everyone about it. You <em>can</em> however
    get notifications for audio releases on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6vHVA4oHPEnt3AqJF6WB64">Spotify</a>
    or <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-brains-minds-and-their-possible-uses/id1617525316">Apple
