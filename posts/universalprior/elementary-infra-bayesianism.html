    <p><strong>Short summary</strong> : I apply the updating equation
    from Infra-Bayesianism to a concrete example of an Infradistribution
    and illustrate the process. When we “care” a lot for things that are
    unlikely given what we’ve observed before, we get updates that are
    extremely sensitive to outliers.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I’ve <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-greedy-doctor-problem?s=w">written
    previously</a> on how to act when confronted with something smarter
    than yourself. When in such a precarious situation, it is difficult
    to trust “the other”; they might dispense their wisdom in a way that
    steers you to their benefit. <a
    href="https://arbital.com/p/Vinge_principle">In general</a>, we’re
    screwed.</p>
    <p>But there are ideas for a constrained set-up that <a
    href="https://openai.com/blog/debate/">forces “the other” to explain
    itself and point out potential flaws in its arguments</a>. We might
    thus leverage “the other”’s ingenuity against itself by slowing down
    its reasoning to our pace. “The other” would no longer be an oracle
    with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia">prophecies that
    might or might not kill us</a> but instead a teacher who lets us see
    things we otherwise couldn’t.</p>
    <p>While that idea is nice, there is a severe flaw at its core: <a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PJLABqQ962hZEqhdB/debate-update-obfuscated-arguments-problem">obfuscation</a>.
    By making the argument sufficiently long and complicated, “the
    other” can sneak a false conclusion past our defenses. Forcing “the
    other” to lay out its reasoning, thus, is not a foolproof solution.
    But (<a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/huNvfttDpxCApC3xZ/an-132-complex-and-subtly-incorrect-arguments-as-an-obstacle#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20not%20really%20sure%20whether%20I%20expect%20this%20to%20be%20a%20problem%20in%20practice">as
    some have argued</a>), it’s unclear whether this will be a problem
    in practice.</p>

    <h1 id="uncertain-updates"><strong>Uncertain updates</strong></h1>
    <p>Imagine it’s late in the night, the lights are off, and you are
    trying to find your smartphone. You cannot turn on the lights, and
    you are having a bit of trouble seeing properly<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-2-53997824">2</a>.
    You have a vague sense about where your smartphone should be (your
    prior, panel <strong>a</strong> ). Then you see a red blinking light
    from your smartphone (sensory evidence, panel <strong>b</strong> ).
    Since your brain is <a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0928425704000841">really
    good at this type of thing</a>, you integrate the sensory evidence
    with your prior optimally<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-3-53997824">3</a>
    to obtain an improved sense of where your smartphone might be
    (posterior, panel <strong>c</strong> ).</p>

    <p>Now let’s say you are even more uncertain about where you put
    your smartphone.<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-4-53997824">4</a>
    It might be one end of the room or the other (bimodal prior, panel
    <strong>a</strong> ). You see a blinking light further to the right
    (sensory evidence, panel <strong>b</strong> ), so your overall
    belief shifts to the right (bimodal posterior, panel
    <strong>c</strong> ). Importantly, by conserving probability mass,
    your belief that the phone might be on the left end of the room is
    reduced. <a

    <p>This is the situation Vanessa Kosoy finds herself in<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-6-53997824">6</a><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-7-53997824">7</a>.
    With Infra-Bayesianism, she proposes a theoretical framework for
    thinking in situations where you can’t (or don’t want to) specify a
    prior over your hypotheses.</p>
    <p>Because she is a mathematician, she is using the proper
    terminology while I’m using the handwavy language of Bayesian
    sensory integration:</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>a <em>signed measure</em> is a generalization of probability
    distributions,</p></li>
    <li><p>an <em>indicator function for a fuzzy set</em> is a
    generalization of your observation/sensory evidence,</p></li>
    <li><p>a continuous function g∈C(X,[0,1]) is… wait, what is
    g?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>g tells you how much you care about stuff that happens in regions
    that become very unlikely/impossible given the sensory evidence you
    obtain. Why should you care about that, you ask? Great question;
    let’s not care about it for now. Let’s set it equal to zero,
    g=0.</p>
    <p>When g=0, the updating equation for our two priors, P1 and P2,
    becomes very familiar indeed:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6992aeaa-d768-491f-b569-5d3805a5c28c_978x236.png"><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6992aeaa-d768-491f-b569-5d3805a5c28c_978x236.png" /></a></p>
    <p>This is basically Bayes’ theorem applied to each prior
    separately. Still, the evidence term (the denominator) is computed
    in a wonky way<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-8-53997824">8</a>,
    but this doesn’t make much difference since it’s a shared scaling
    factor. Consistently, things also look very normal when using this
    updating rule to integrate sensory information. We shift our two
    priors towards the evidence and scale them proportional to how
    unlikely they said the evidence is.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38488f90-80ce-427e-b8f9-7ada74e15836_3413x659.png"><img

    this picture looks almost identical to the previous section, notice
    that the posterior is still split in two! Thus, we can still tell
    which one of our initial guesses turned out to be “more
    accurate”.</p>
    <h1
    id="fundamentally-_-dangerous_-updates"><strong>Fundamentally</strong>
    _ <strong>dangerous</strong>_ <strong>updates</strong></h1>
    <p>Alright, you know where this is going. We will have to start
    caring about things that become less likely after observing the
    evidence. Why we have to care is a bit hard to motivate; Vanessa
    Kossoy and Diffractor motivate in <a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/CmrW8fCmSLK7E25sa/p/YAa4qcMyoucRS2Ykr#:~:text=will%20confuse%20you.-,First,-%2C%20what%20sorts%20of">three

    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-10-53997824">10</a>.</p>
    <p>Instead, I will motivate why you might care about things that
    seem very unlikely given your evidence by revealing more information
    about the thought experiment:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d787c9-83f9-498e-8138-076b5d870433_1072x659.png"><img

    <p>It’s not so much that you <em>can’t</em> give your best guess
    estimate about where you put your smartphone. Rather, you
    <em>dare</em> not. Getting this wrong would be, like, <em>really
    bad</em>. You might be unsure whether it’s even your phone that’s
    blinking or if it’s the phone of the other person sleeping in the
    room<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-11-53997824">11</a>.
    Or perhaps the bright red light you see is the <a
    href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/deceptively-aligned-mesa-optimizers?s=r#:~:text=prime%20minister.-,So,-%3A%20suppose%20we%20train">bulbous
    red nose</a> of somebody else sleeping in the room. Getting the
    location of your smartphone wrong would be messy. Better not risk
    it. We’ll set g=1.</p>
    <p>The update rule doesn’t change too much at first glance<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-12-53997824">12</a>:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6852a5d0-006d-4697-a0fb-c158d28059be_1168x238.png"><img

    the denominator changes from one wonky thing (P+) to another (P−);
    but that still doesn’t matter since it’s the same for both
    equations.</p>
    <p>But there is a ϰ that showed up out of nowhere! ϰ is a variable
    that tells us how good our distribution is at <em>explaining things
    we did not get any evidence for</em><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-13-53997824">13</a>.
    Intuitively, you can tell that this will favor the prior
    distribution that was previously punished for not explaining the
    observation. And indeed, when we run the simulation:</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6eae1bd1-b8aa-444e-accb-5ae2a197ff9d_3413x659.png"><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6eae1bd1-b8aa-444e-accb-5ae2a197ff9d_3413x659.png" /></a></p>
    <p>One of the two “distributions”<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/elementary-infra-bayesianism#footnote-14-53997824">14</a>
    is taking off! Even though the corresponding prior was bad at
    explaining the observation, the updating still <em>strongly</em>
    increases the mass associated with that hypothesis.</p>
    <p>Intuitively this translates into something like:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>You are unsure about the location of your smartphone (and
    mortally afraid to get it wrong). You follow the red blinking light,
    but you never discard your alternative hypothesis that the
    smartphone might be at the other end of the room. At the slightest
    indication that something is off you’ll discard all the information
    you have collected and start the search from scratch.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is a <em>very</em> cautious strategy, and it might be
    appropriate when you’re in dangerous domains with the potential for
    catastrophic outliers, basically what Nassim Taleb calls <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable">Black
    Swan</a> events. I’m not sure how <em>productive</em> this strategy
    is, though; noise might dramatically mess up your updates at some
    point.</p>

    <p>This concludes the introduction to Elementary Infrabayesianism. I
    realize that I have only scratched the surface of what’s in <a

    <p>I’m afraid at this point I’m obliged to add a hot take on what
    all of this means for AI Safety. I’m not sure. I can tell myself a
    story about how being <em>very careful</em> about how quickly you
    discard alternative hypotheses/narrow down the hypothesis space is
    important. I can also see the outline of how this framework ties in
    with <a

    <p>Not the coming home drunk situation, only the fundamental
    confusing part. Oh no, that came out wrong. What I mean is that she
    is trying to become <em>less</em> fundamentally confused. Urgh. I’ll

    <p>A proper infradistribution would have to be a convex set of
    distributions and upper complete and everything. Also, the support
    of the Gaussians would have to be compact. But for the example I’m
    constructing, this won’t become relevant. The edge points (the two
    Gaussians) of the convex set fully characterize how the entire
    convex set changes.</p>

    <p>I’m still calling them distributions, although we’ve left that
    territory already in the last section. More appropriate would be
    something like “density function of the signed measure” or
    “Radon-Nikodym derivative”.</p>
