  <p>In a recent <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/applied-mathematical-logic-for-the">lunch
      conversation</a><sup>[1]</sup>, a colleague of mine explained her
    system for reading scientific papers. She calls the system
    tongue-in-cheek ” <em>not</em> reading the paper”. It goes as
    follows:</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[1] </p>
    <p>Perhaps the largest amount of value I have extracted from my
      graduate studies comes from being surrounded by brilliant people who
      occasionally <em>need</em> nutrients, at which point I can ambush
      them with questions. What are they going to do? Starve?</p>
  </div>
  <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>Read the title and predict what the abstract will say. If you
      are correct, stop reading the paper.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, read the abstract and predict what the main results
      will be. If you are correct, stop reading the paper.</li>
    <li>Read the last paragraph of the introduction or the first
      paragraph of the discussion and predict the details of the results.
      If you are correct, stop reading the paper.</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I love this system, mostly because of the flippant name, but also
    because it points out that “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes">the
      emperor is naked</a>”. It is a bit of an <a

      href="https://www.cold-takes.com/honesty-about-reading/">secret</a>
    that “not reading the paper” is the only feasible strategy for
    staying on top of the <a href="http://blog.cdnsciencepub.com/21st-century-science-overload/">ever-increasing
      mountain of academic literature</a>. But while everybody knows
    this<sup>[2]</sup>, not <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/common-knowledge">everybody
      knows that everybody knows this</a>. On discussion boards, some
    researchers claim with a straight face to be reading <a
      href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_many_papers_do_I_have_to_read_per_month_as_a_researcher">100
      papers per month</a>. Skimming 100 papers per month might be
    possible, but reading them is not<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>

    <p>If you are an exception please get in touch with me, we should

    <p><strong>Argyle</strong><sup>[6]</sup>: Okay, level with me here.
      How can you just <em>not</em> read the paper? <strong>How do you
        know what’s written in it</strong>?</p>
    <div class="sidenote">

      <p>Now I see why <a
          href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ax695frGJEzGxFBK4/biology-inspired-agi-timelines-the-trick-that-never-works">EY
          is doing this so much</a>! This is <em>fun</em>!</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Well, when I was new at this, I did read
      a <em>lot</em> of papers very carefully. I got stuck a lot, redid a
      lot of the calculations, double-checked the methodology, asked my
      colleagues…</p>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But you don’t anymore?</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Sometimes I do! That’s what journal
      clubs and coffee breaks are good for. But I don’t have the time to
      do this for most papers anymore. I also want to produce <em>new</em>
      research. And I also notice that, from experience, I usually have a
      pretty good idea of “where a paper is going”. I usually have seen a
      poster presentation of the research somewhere, or read a thread on
      Twitter. Or I know the work that usually comes out of the senior
      author’s lab and that lets me fill in the blanks.</p>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But those are only rules of thumb. What
      if you’re wrong?</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : I <em>do</em> still look at the paper,
      and if its substantially different from what I anticipate, I
      <em>do</em> read it more carefully. Also, if it’s <em>really</em>
      surprising, then it’ll bubble up on Twitter. <strong>I’ve become
        very efficient at identifying the delta between what I already know
        and what a paper adds.</strong>

    <strong>Schematic</strong> <strong>of “the delta” added by a
      (typical) academic paper.</strong> Papers you have read before are
    shown in the background with an orange background. Relationships
    between papers are indicated with double-sided arrows. The size and
    shape of the orange background represent the statements you believe
    are likely to be true. The newly added paper is shown in the
    foreground on a blue background. The portion that the new paper
    makes likely to be true (or, sometimes, demonstrates to be true) is
    “the delta”.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : I’m not convinced, but that’s not even
      my only issue. Let’s assume you <em>are</em> able to roughly predict
      “the delta”. <strong>How are you able to assess reliability of their
        method</strong>? How do you know their study isn’t fundamentally
      flawed?</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : I’d like to say that that’s what
      peer-review is for, but I probably <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/">couldn’t keep a straight
        face while saying that</a>. Not all is lost though. You don’t even
      have to dig into the methodology a lot, with just <a
        href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/">2.5
        minutes of reading</a> and a <a
        href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/">smidgeon
        of common sense</a> you can get a decent estimate of the probability
      that a study will replicate. And beyond that, you should probably
      <em>always</em> include substantial uncertainty in your assessment
      of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/">any
        single study</a><sup>[7]</sup>. Before you see a well-done
      meta-analysis of dozens of studies that find the same thing, you
      should probably not include the results in your mental database of
      facts. <strong>The trick is, I guess, to get a quick first-order
        approximation and to assume low reliability by default.</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="sidenote">
      <p>[7] </p>
      <p>Am I guilty of relying on single studies when I link them in
        every second sentence? I hope not, those links are supposed to be
        pointers for people who want to dig deeper into a topic - not
        “proofs by authority”. But it’s a difficult line to walk.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But you are part of the problem! If
      people did read papers carefully then weak methodology would be
      noticed much faster and the solid studies could stand out.</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Ah, yes, that would be great, but the
      problem runs deeper. Even if you read every word carefully, who says
      that the authors included all the relevant information? Researchers
      routinely <a href="https://promocell.com/in-the-lab/antibiotics-in-cell-culture-friend-or-enemy/">add
        antibiotics to their cultures to combat infections</a>, but don’t
      usually mention this fact in papers because it is seen as a red flag
      for a “dirty lab environment”. Whether mice are housed in an
      enriched environment (with toys etc.) can have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35044558">substantial
        effects
        on brain anatomy and function</a>, but this is also usually not
      reported. And even <em>if</em> researchers wanted to report
      everything, “high impact journals” often <a
        href="https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2015/06/10/can-a-scientific-paper-be-too-short-part-ii/">reward
        extreme brevity</a> and don’t allow more than <a
        href="https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide#:~:text=2000%2D2500%20words">2000-2500
        words</a> to summarize years of research. The list goes on and on.
      And even <em>if</em> the incentives weren’t so misaligned, part of
      the problem is that we don’t even <em>know</em> which factors are
      important. <strong>So a proper reliability estimate might simply be
        impossible given just what is written in the text.</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : Oh boy, I’m getting dizzy.</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Take a seat, it’s normal. You’ll get
      used to it.</p>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But… How can <em>any</em> of this work?
      <strong>Is there a benevolent science god that makes sure that
        everything turns out alright?</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Ahahahahaha, that would be nice,
      wouldn’t it? I think we have two non-divine factors on our side that
      help push science forward. One is the discrepancy between what you
      are “allowed to write in a paper” and the “actual reasons that lead
      you to believe something”. When you do an experiment, your sample
      size is probably twice as large as what you report, but half of
      those animals cannot be included in the paper because there was
      something wrong with the animal, the procedure didn’t work, there
      was bleeding, imaging quality is subpar… Those data points are not
      reported, but the experimenter still uses them <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief-update">update their
        beliefs</a> about what is going on. The same goes for theoretical
      studies, where a lot of the auxiliary results just don’t make it
      into the paper, but they still support the main message. There is a
      kind of narrative that emerges from all of those pieces and it
      rhymes in a way that’s hard to put on paper, but it’s still
      fortifying your hypothesis. <strong>The inferences in a scientific
        paper are usually supported by multiple strands of logic and
        converging evidence, not all of which are included in the
        paper.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_30.png" />
    <strong>The data presented in the paper is usually just a subset of
      the data recorded.</strong> Data that is not included might be
    incomplete, partially corrupted, or with slightly incompatible
    parameters. Even though mice are depicted, the same argument also
    holds for theoretical arguments where redundant derivations and
    exploratory results are usually not included.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : That’s scant consolation. Aren’t humans
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">infamously
        good at deceiving themselves</a>? Perhaps I can trust all those
      studies a bit more, but <strong>most of them will likely still turn
        out to be wrong?</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : You shouldn’t underestimate the
      importance of a good narrative. There is some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Beauty_Is_Truth">really
        weird link between beauty and truth</a> that I don’t quite
      understand, and it might also apply to “beautiful stories”…</p>

      are right, most things will <a
        href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">probably
        turn out to be wrong</a> (or at least not quite right). But this
      brings me to the second non-divine factor that helps science: it

    papers” is a fix, not a solution.</h2>
  <p>As useful as the method might be, it is borne out of necessity,
    not because it is the optimal way of conducting research.
    <strong>The scientific paper, as it exists, has one central
      shortcoming:</strong> <strong>The author(s) do not know the
      reader.</strong> When writing a paper the author(s) try to break
    down their explanations to the smallest common denominator of
    hypothetical readers. As a consequence, no actual reader is served
    in an ideal way. A beginner might require a lot more background. An
    expert might care for more raw data and for more speculative
    discussions. A researcher from an adjacent field might need
    translations for certain terminology. A reader from the future might
    want to know how the study connects to future work. None of those
    get what they want from the average paper.
  </p>
  <p>It would be <em>so</em> much better to just always have the
    chance to talk to the author instead of reading their
    paper<sup>[10]</sup>. You could go quickly over the easy parts and
    go deep on the parts you find difficult. I <em>think</em> this is
    what is supposed to happen in question sessions after a talk, but
    when there are more than three people in the audience the idea
    rapidly falls apart<sup>[11]</sup>. I <em>know</em> that this is
    what usually happens<sup>[12]</sup> at conferences and workshops
    during tea time, where the senior researchers talk with each other
    to get actually <em>useful</em> descriptions of a research project
    from each other.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">

    <p>I realize that this criticism also applies to me. As always, feel
      free to grab some time for a chat in my <a href="https://calendly.com/jan-kirchner/one-hour-slot">calendly</a>.

    <p>Some disagree and argue that question sessions are useful, but
      those people are just kidding themselves. To me, they seem like a
      terribly obnoxious way to show off arcane expertise (if the question
      is deep and irrelevant to everyone except the asker) or a gigantic
      waste of time (if the question is obvious and was already answered
      in the talk). I realize that my position here is pretty extreme and
      I can’t quite articulate why I feel so strongly about this.</p>

  <p>This clearly <a href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-scaling-academia">does
      not scale</a>. What would be a better solution? <a href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq">Arbital</a>
    tried
    something in this direction by offering explanations with different
    “speeds”, but the platform has become defunct<sup>[13]</sup>. <a href="https://elicit.org/">Elicit</a> from Ought
    might have
    something like this on the menu at some point in the future, but at
    the moment results are not personalized (afaict). What we ideally
    might want is a “<a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks">researcher
      in a box</a>” that can answer questions about their field of
    expertise on demand. Whenever the original researcher has finished a
    project, the new insights become available from the box. This sounds
    implausible, after all, <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/xI3Ek/comment/134266723">you can’t
      expect the researcher to hang around all day, can you</a>? But I
    think there is a way to make it work with language models. In the
    next post in this series, I will outline my progress on this
    question. Stay tuned!</p>

    <p>I’m undecided if the approach was flawed or if they were ahead of
      their time.</p>
