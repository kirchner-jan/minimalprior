    paper.</strong></h1>
    <p>In a recent <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/applied-mathematical-logic-for-the">lunch
    conversation</a><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-not-reading-papers#footnote-1-45773700">1</a>,
    a colleague of mine explained her system for reading scientific
    papers. She calls the system tongue-in-cheek ” <em>not</em> reading
    the paper”. It goes as follows:</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li><p>Read the title and predict what the abstract will say. If you
    are correct, stop reading the paper.</p></li>
    <li><p>Otherwise, read the abstract and predict what the main
    results will be. If you are correct, stop reading the
    paper.</p></li>
    <li><p>Read the last paragraph of the introduction or the first
    paragraph of the discussion and predict the details of the results.
    If you are correct, stop reading the paper.</p></li>
    <li><p>etc.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I love this system, mostly because of the flippant name, but also
    because it points out that “<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes">the
    emperor is naked</a>”. It is a bit of an <a
    href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-read-research-papers-quickly">open</a><a
    href="https://www.cold-takes.com/honesty-about-reading/">secret</a>
    that “not reading the paper” is the only feasible strategy for
    staying on top of the <a
    href="http://blog.cdnsciencepub.com/21st-century-science-overload/">ever-increasing
    mountain of academic literature</a>. But while everybody knows
    this<a

    not <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/common-knowledge">everybody

    <p><strong>Argyle</strong><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-not-reading-papers#footnote-6-45773700">6</a>:
    Okay, level with me here. How can you just <em>not</em> read the
    paper? <strong>How do you know what’s written in it</strong>?</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Well, when I was new at this, I did read
    a <em>lot</em> of papers very carefully. I got stuck a lot, redid a
    lot of the calculations, double-checked the methodology, asked my
    colleagues…</p>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But you don’t anymore?</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Sometimes I do! That’s what journal
    clubs and coffee breaks are good for. But I don’t have the time to
    do this for most papers anymore. I also want to produce <em>new</em>
    research. And I also notice that, from experience, I usually have a
    pretty good idea of “where a paper is going”. I usually have seen a
    poster presentation of the research somewhere, or read a thread on
    Twitter. Or I know the work that usually comes out of the senior
    author’s lab and that lets me fill in the blanks.</p>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But those are only rules of thumb. What
    if you’re wrong?</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : I <em>do</em> still look at the paper,
    and if its substantially different from what I anticipate, I
    <em>do</em> read it more carefully. Also, if it’s <em>really</em>
    surprising, then it’ll bubble up on Twitter. <strong>I’ve become
    very efficient at identifying the delta between what I already know
    and what a paper adds.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <strong>Schematic</strong> <strong>of “the delta” added by a
    (typical) academic paper.</strong> Papers you have read before are
    shown in the background with an orange background. Relationships
    between papers are indicated with double-sided arrows. The size and
    shape of the orange background represent the statements you believe
    are likely to be true. The newly added paper is shown in the
    foreground on a blue background. The portion that the new paper
    makes likely to be true (or, sometimes, demonstrates to be true) is
    “the delta”.</p>
    <hr />
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : I’m not convinced, but that’s not even
    my only issue. Let’s assume you <em>are</em> able to roughly predict
    “the delta”. <strong>How are you able to assess reliability of their
    method</strong>? How do you know their study isn’t fundamentally
    flawed?</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : I’d like to say that that’s what
    peer-review is for, but I probably <a
    href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/">couldn’t keep a straight
    face while saying that</a>. Not all is lost though. You don’t even
    have to dig into the methodology a lot, with just <a
    href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/">2.5
    minutes of reading</a> and a <a
    href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2021/11/18/how-i-made-10k-predicting-which-papers-will-replicate/">smidgeon
    of common sense</a> you can get a decent estimate of the probability
    that a study will replicate. And beyond that, you should probably
    <em>always</em> include substantial uncertainty in your assessment
    of <a
    href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/">any
    single study</a><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-not-reading-papers#footnote-7-45773700">7</a>.
    Before you see a well-done meta-analysis of dozens of studies that
    find the same thing, you should probably not include the results in
    your mental database of facts. <strong>The trick is, I guess, to get
    a quick first-order approximation and to assume low reliability by
    default.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But you are part of the problem! If
    people did read papers carefully then weak methodology would be
    noticed much faster and the solid studies could stand out.</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Ah, yes, that would be great, but the
    problem runs deeper. Even if you read every word carefully, who says
    that the authors included all the relevant information? Researchers
    routinely <a
    href="https://promocell.com/in-the-lab/antibiotics-in-cell-culture-friend-or-enemy/">add
    antibiotics to their cultures to combat infections</a>, but don’t
    usually mention this fact in papers because it is seen as a red flag
    for a “dirty lab environment”. Whether mice are housed in an
    enriched environment (with toys etc.) can have <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35044558">substantial effects
    on brain anatomy and function</a>, but this is also usually not
    reported. And even <em>if</em> researchers wanted to report
    everything, “high impact journals” often <a
    href="https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2015/06/10/can-a-scientific-paper-be-too-short-part-ii/">reward
    extreme brevity</a> and don’t allow more than <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide#:~:text=2000%2D2500%20words">2000-2500
    words</a> to summarize years of research. The list goes on and on.
    And even <em>if</em> the incentives weren’t so misaligned, part of
    the problem is that we don’t even <em>know</em> which factors are
    important. <strong>So a proper reliability estimate might simply be
    impossible given just what is written in the text.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : Oh boy, I’m getting dizzy.</p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Take a seat, it’s normal. You’ll get
    used to it.</p>
    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : But… How can <em>any</em> of this work?
    <strong>Is there a benevolent science god that makes sure that
    everything turns out alright?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : Ahahahahaha, that would be nice,
    wouldn’t it? I think we have two non-divine factors on our side that
    help push science forward. One is the discrepancy between what you
    are “allowed to write in a paper” and the “actual reasons that lead
    you to believe something”. When you do an experiment, your sample
    size is probably twice as large as what you report, but half of
    those animals cannot be included in the paper because there was
    something wrong with the animal, the procedure didn’t work, there
    was bleeding, imaging quality is subpar… Those data points are not
    reported, but the experimenter still uses them <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief-update">update their
    beliefs</a> about what is going on. The same goes for theoretical
    studies, where a lot of the auxiliary results just don’t make it
    into the paper, but they still support the main message. There is a
    kind of narrative that emerges from all of those pieces and it
    rhymes in a way that’s hard to put on paper, but it’s still
    fortifying your hypothesis. <strong>The inferences in a scientific
    paper are usually supported by multiple strands of logic and
    converging evidence, not all of which are included in the
    paper.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <strong>The data presented in the paper is usually just a subset of
    the data recorded.</strong> Data that is not included might be
    incomplete, partially corrupted, or with slightly incompatible
    parameters. Even though mice are depicted, the same argument also
    holds for theoretical arguments where redundant derivations and
    exploratory results are usually not included.</p>

    <p><strong>Argyle</strong> : That’s scant consolation. Aren’t humans
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">infamously
    good at deceiving themselves</a>? Perhaps I can trust all those
    studies a bit more, but <strong>most of them will likely still turn
    out to be wrong?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Belka</strong> : You shouldn’t underestimate the
    importance of a good narrative. There is some <a

    <p>As useful as the method might be, it is borne out of necessity,
    not because it is the optimal way of conducting research.
    <strong>The scientific paper, as it exists, has one central
    shortcoming:</strong> <strong>The author(s) do not know the
    reader.</strong> When writing a paper the author(s) try to break
    down their explanations to the smallest common denominator of
    hypothetical readers. As a consequence, no actual reader is served
    in an ideal way. A beginner might require a lot more background. An
    expert might care for more raw data and for more speculative
    discussions. A researcher from an adjacent field might need
    translations for certain terminology. A reader from the future might
    want to know how the study connects to future work. None of those
    get what they want from the average paper.</p>
    <p>It would be <em>so</em> much better to just always have the
    chance to talk to the author instead of reading their paper<a

    happen in question sessions after a talk, but when there are more
    than three people in the audience the idea rapidly falls apart<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-not-reading-papers#footnote-11-45773700">11</a>.
    I <em>know</em> that this is what usually happens<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-not-reading-papers#footnote-12-45773700">12</a>
    at conferences and workshops during tea time, where the senior
    researchers talk with each other to get actually <em>useful</em>
    descriptions of a research project from each other.</p>
    <p>This clearly <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-scaling-academia">does
    not scale</a>. What would be a better solution? <a
    href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq">Arbital</a> tried
    something in this direction by offering explanations with different
    “speeds”, but the platform has become defunct<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/on-not-reading-papers#footnote-13-45773700">13</a>.
    <a href="https://elicit.org/">Elicit</a> from Ought might have
    something like this on the menu at some point in the future, but at
    the moment results are not personalized (afaict). What we ideally
    might want is a “<a
    href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks">researcher
    in a box</a>” that can answer questions about their field of
    expertise on demand. Whenever the original researcher has finished a
    project, the new insights become available from the box. This sounds
    implausible, after all, <a
    href="https://imgur.com/gallery/xI3Ek/comment/134266723">you can’t
    expect the researcher to hang around all day, can you</a>? But I
    think there is a way to make it work with language models. In the
    next post in this series, I will outline my progress on this
    question. Stay tuned!</p>

    <p>Perhaps the largest amount of value I have extracted from my
    graduate studies comes from being surrounded by brilliant people who
    occasionally <em>need</em> nutrients, at which point I can ambush
    them with questions. What are they going to do? Starve?</p>

    <p>Am I guilty of relying on single studies when I link them in
    every second sentence? I hope not, those links are supposed to be
    pointers for people who want to dig deeper into a topic - not
    “proofs by authority”. But it’s a difficult line to walk.</p>

    <p>Note that this is not a guarantee or a theorem. It’s just an
    empirically observed tendency.</p>

    <p>I got a bit carried away there and things turned cheesy. But I
    really started to like the two, and it felt cruel not to give them
    that.</p>

    <p>I realize that this criticism also applies to me. As always, feel
    free to grab some time for a chat in my <a

    <p>Some disagree and argue that question sessions are useful, but
    those people are just kidding themselves. To me, they seem like a
    terribly obnoxious way to show off arcane expertise (if the question
    is deep and irrelevant to everyone except the asker) or a gigantic
    waste of time (if the question is obvious and was already answered
    in the talk). I realize that my position here is pretty extreme and
    I can’t quite articulate why I feel so strongly about this.</p>

    <p>I’m undecided if the approach was flawed or if they were ahead of
    their time.</p>
