      <p><em>I’ve been thinking a lot about the past and the future
      lately. And in particular about my values. In this… thing, I try
      to articulate something hard to articulate; my admiration for the
      great big everything and my strong desire to keep it going. I hope
      it’s not too confusing and I don’t blame you for skipping this
      one.</em></p>

      <p>“The way they are spending, a split appears inevitable. It’s
      egregious. I get the argument that it makes sense to focus on
      scalability, but my heart aches when I hear these stories.”</p>

      <p>Two weekends ago I flew out to London to meet some friends and
      to think. I’ve been at one of these events before, and it’s always
      rather <em>intense</em>. Being surrounded by brilliant minds
      buzzing with the urge to <em>do</em> something certainly has the
      potential to blow a fuse or two.</p>
      <p>But these days, I am not in a competitive mood most of the
      time. I marvel and absorb whatever comes my way. Indeed, my best
      conversations didn’t happen with any single person - they were a
      potpourri of ideas and opinions, picked up and spread from person
      to person, amplified and refined at each step.</p>

      <pre><code> _Some fortuitous turn of fate put me at the table with the artsy, cool kids that I had admired from a distance for a long time.

But my feral moods only ever showed on my inside; I was a shy kid, after all._</code></pre>

      <pre><code> _It took months or perhaps a year until they invited me to one of their hangouts. Naturally, it was a total disaster. Rather than being introduced into a world of constant excitement and wonder, we were just a handful of kids sitting around a table, not knowing what to say to each other. We all want the same things, don&#39;t we._</code></pre>

      <p>“So what is your current take on… everything?” I ask, not
      wasting any time.</p>
      <p>“Everything everything?”</p>
      <p>“Well, perhaps mostly the funding influx and what is happening
      to the community.”</p>
      <p>“It’s complicated. This influx is, of course, exactly what we
      dreamed of in the beginning. But it’s also a lot to process, and
      things are moving very fast. And if you care about helping people
      <em>right now</em> , it’s hard to accept some of the things that
      are happening. $4000 can save a <em>life,</em> you know. On
      average.”</p>
      <p>“…”</p>
      <p>“And I don’t want to argue against longtermism. I can do the EV
      calculation as well as you can. I’m just saying that the
      <em>contrast</em> is getting rather grotesque. I’m not sure all of
      this can still be called <em>one</em> unified thing.”</p>
      <p>“But that’s kind of … sad?”</p>
      <p>“I agree, it doesn’t feel right. There is a core somewhere that
      ties everything and everyone together, but I can’t put my finger
      on it. Something that differentiates an EA from a random
      futurist/transhumanist/extropian. Any ideas?”</p>

      <hr />
      <p>Night crept upon us, and then the event was over. I heard about
      the parties, which are not an official part of the event but still
      are a highlight for many. I feel torn. I rarely desire to drag
      things out, borrow a bit of time from my future self, and cling to
      the present. This night I feel a little bit of that desire. But I
      also feel the gravitational pull of the bed in my AirBnB, and I
      know how parties are for me. They don’t work from a cost-benefit
      perspective.</p>

      <pre><code>I walk home alone. _Ah no, with two friends._ _They are talking about the Sahara desert and how you can repurpose an old fire engine to travel through the desert. In fact, you can fit an entire family into that thing and just go from village to village. And you&#39;ll have all eyes on you when you arrive; what a ridiculous(ly awesome) scene._</code></pre>
      <p>I yawn. The fire engine story doesn’t move me. Even the
      excitement of my friends does not manage to jump over. I used to
      be very worried about that; why don’t I like what other people
      like? But the angst has been in retrograde for a long while now,
      and I’ve learned to like myself<sup>[1]</sup>. And it’s even more
      than that. I’ve learned to like <em>everyone else,</em> too, even
      if they talk about fire engines. <em>Especially</em> when they
      talk about fire engines.</p>

      <p>Most of the time.</p>

      <p>I draw energy from that thought. This is what humanity
      <em>is</em>. It’s driving a fire engine through the desert and
      rejoicing. It’s partying through the night, bonfires, night swims,
      friendship, art, and awkwardness. It’s <a
      href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cRsPfkyAKZ3crxynB/get-in-the-van">climbing
      into a random van</a> and going on adventures. It sits at the core
      of everything.</p>
      <p>I don’t tend to do those things myself too much. I love numbers
      and thinking about the future. I am restless. And I am fine.
      Caring about numbers is humanity, too, you know. We might be
      somewhat different, you and I, but in the end, we all want the
      same things.</p>
