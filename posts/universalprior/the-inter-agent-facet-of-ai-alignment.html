    thought!</em></p>
    <p>We argue that <a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/SzecSPYxqRa5GCaSF/clarifying-inner-alignment-terminology">intent
    alignment and capability robustness</a> do not capture the full
    “chain of command” (i.e., “alignment” without any qualifier) from
    the programmer’s intentions to an AI agent’s real-world impact, but
    stops at the stage where the agent performs its actions. We argue
    that, especially in complex <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system">Multi-Agent
    Systems</a> (MAS), this is not sufficient to actually achieve
    aligned outcomes<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-inter-agent-facet-of-ai-alignment#footnote-1-73850726">1</a>.
    Therefore, we introduce another facet of AI Alignment, which deals
    with the connection between an agent’s intention and its actual
    impact, due to multi-agent interactions (as opposed to capability
    robustness).</p>

    <h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
    <p>Independent of whether the first AGIs will be Tool or Agent AIs,
    they will most likely not live and act in an empty space. Instead,
    they will interact and communicate with humans and other AGIs in a
    variety of ways, thereby effectively creating a socio-technical
    system or an AI-based society.</p>
    <p>As a consequence, the effects that an AGI will have on its
    environment, i.e., the world, will not necessarily coincide with the
    effects that the AGI plans to have, since actions in such systems
    commonly interfere and influence/cancel each other.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, leads to the conclusion that it is not sufficient
    to build an AGI which satisfies intent alignment and capability
    robustness. Instead, we need one more step to be controlled: The
    step from an AGI’s <em>robust intention</em> to its societal
    <em>impact</em>.</p>

    <p>In Evan Hubinger’s <a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/SzecSPYxqRa5GCaSF/clarifying-inner-alignment-terminology">alignment
    terminology</a>, alignment is the result of intent alignment (which
    is, in turn, composed of the well-known concepts of inner and outer
    alignment, among others) and capability robustness. The implicit
    assumption is that the AGI’s model is equivalent to how its actions
    will affect the world.</p>

    system is doing (and not just its own actions), inter-agent

    <p>Our central argument is that multi-agent interactions add a
    sufficient amount of complexity to an AI agent’s action policy to
    justify its own type of alignment, separated from the existing
    alignment model. Adding inter-agent alignment to the alignment tree,
    we see that it complements intent alignment and capability
    robustness, resulting in full alignment (i.e., impact alignment)<a

    <h1 id="challenging-questions">Challenging Questions</h1>
    <h2
    id="why-is-inter-agent-alignment-not-just-a-part-of-intent-alignment">Why
    is inter-agent alignment not just a part of intent alignment?</h2>
    <p>Intent alignment is a part of a single AGI without any reference
    to multi-agent systems. Of course, we could expand its meaning, but
    since the steps between the programmer’s intentions and the AGI’s
    impact can be neatly broken down, we argue that it makes sense to
    introduce a new term for this additional dimension.</p>
    <p>Naturally, one can always argue that <em>a sufficiently advanced
    AGI will be able to see through this dilemma and resolve it</em><a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-inter-agent-facet-of-ai-alignment#footnote-3-73850726">3</a>,
    but this seems to be a variant of the No-True-Scotsman fallacy: As
    long as we can imagine an AGI which is advanced enough to interact
    with other agents, but not able to successfully coordinate their
    actions and therefore avoid unintended outcomes, inter-agent
    alignment is a problem that needs to be addressed. Independent
    learners using state-of-the-art RL algorithms like DQN or PPO
    provide evidence that these “medium-level” agents do, in fact,
    exist.</p>
    <h2
    id="what-does-it-look-like-if-an-agi-is-intent-aligned-and-capability-robust-but-not-inter-agent-aligned">What
    does it look like if an AGI is intent aligned and capability robust,
    but not inter-agent aligned?</h2>
    <p>The <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy
    of the Commons</a> is the most prominent example for the fact that
    the result of selfish optimization of multiple agents is not always
    optimal for them. In the more general case of a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem">Social
    Dilemma</a>, “individuals would be better off cooperating but fail
    to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that
    discourage joint action”. In such a setting, each agent may well be
    fully aligned with the goal which it was designed to achieve, but
    still fail to reach this goal due to the incentive to defect from
    the cooperative solution.</p>
    <h2 id="how-can-inter-agent-alignment-be-solved">How can inter-agent
    alignment be solved?</h2>
    <p>Game Theory and Multi-Agent Systems deal with this challenge (we
    call the problem <em>multi-agent governance</em> ): If the reward
    function of the AGI(s) can be arbitrarily altered by a designer, we
    can change them in a way that produces a desired system equilibrium
    (i.e., strategies of all participating AGIs, which, in combination,
    result in a desired system outcome). If, on the other hand, the
    reward functions are not (easily) controlled by the designer,
    restricting the AGI’s action space might still enable the designer
    to generate desirable equilibria (or at least prevent undesired
    states from being stable).</p>
    <p>For both types of governance, it can be doubted whether they are
    effective in face of a sufficiently advanced AGI, since both
    represent artificial rules which are not physical boundaries for the
    AGI and can therefore be overthrown.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, humans <em>have</em> solved social dilemmas
    with out-of-the box instruments like contracts, compensation for
    cooperating, or exploiting psychological conditions. These solutions
    (usually classified into motivational, strategic and structural
    solutions) could be used as starting points for equipping AGIs with
    inter-agent alignment capabilities.</p>
    <h2
    id="will-an-agi-society-act-in-the-same-way-that-we-expect-from-a-traditional-multi-agent-system">Will
    an AGI society act in the same way that we expect from a traditional
    Multi-Agent System?</h2>
    <p>In general, the MAS model captures any type of participating
    agents, no matter how they are structured internally. However, it
    suffers from many of the limitations that we also find in Markov
    Decision Processes, e.g., action spaces and reward functions are
    assumed to be fixed, the (observable) environment is the only
    communication channel between agents, and agents maximize their
    expected future reward, given their observations. A sufficiently
    evolved AGI likely will find ways to overcome these assumptions,
    thereby achieving some other goals which are not captured by the
    traditional reward function, and at the same time acting in ways
    that are unexpected from the perspective of the system designer. A
    very simple example of this would be forming an AGI coalition to
    coordinate and seize power.</p>
    <h2
    id="what-happens-if-there-is-only-one-agi-but-in-a-world-full-of-other-actors-humansnations">What
    happens if there is only one AGI, but in a world full of other
    actors (humans/nations)?</h2>
    <p>The fundamental challenge that selfish optimization of an action
    policy does not guarantee the intended outcome as soon as other
    actors are present, does not depend on the nature of those other
    actors: As long as the environment is non-stationary from the
    perspective of an individual agent, convergence of its action policy
    cannot be guaranteed.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the discussion does not rely on a society which
    consists exclusively (or even mostly) of AGI agents.</p>
    <h2 id="why-should-we-prioritize-inter-agent-alignment">Why should
    we prioritize inter-agent alignment?</h2>
    <p>In our opinion, inter-agent alignment is highly neglected,
    compared to intent alignment. It seems like most research focuses on
    a single AGI agent whose learned policy has exactly the intended
    impact in the world. Our crucial point is that, as soon as multiple
    such AGIs exist and interact, this model ceases to be accurate
    enough to predict the outcomes of these interactions. Just as social
    phenomena cannot simply be explained by analyzing individual humans,
    we argue that interactions of multiple AGIs require a social
    perspective on alignment.</p>

    <p>Optimizing an objective in the real world can also be hard if
    there’s only a single agent, such that intent alignment isn’t
    sufficient for impact alignment. Nevertheless, multi-agent settings,
    especially with multiple superhuman AIs, seem like the most
    challenging case.</p>

    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-inter-agent-facet-of-ai-alignment#footnote-anchor-2-73850726">2</a></p>
    <p>I fact, we suspect there might be other requirements for full
    alignment (unless we just use one of the existing terms as an
    umbrella).</p>

    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/the-inter-agent-facet-of-ai-alignment#footnote-anchor-3-73850726">3</a></p>
    <p>A stronger version of this argument (due to Erik Jenner) would
    be: <em>Assuming that humans can solve this problem, so could a
    (super-)human-level AI agent. If the agent is not able to solve this
    problem, it should hopefully at least figure out that it could ask
    humans for help. An agent that does so badly in multi-agent settings
    that it leads to a big catastrophe, and doesn’t check in with humans
    before acting, is either not intent-aligned, or has some very
    peculiar capabilities blindspots.</em></p>
