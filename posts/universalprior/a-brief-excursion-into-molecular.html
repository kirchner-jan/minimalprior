    <p>(33 likes is a <em>lot</em> on neurotwitter.)</p>
    <p>There was a bit of goofy back and forth about the (un)importance
    of mathematical vocabulary in neuroscience, some attempts at
    explaining the term, and eventually the call for a workshop on
    “Manifold-splaining”, which happened half a year
    later<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

    <p>There are some things to be said here about how we use

    are<sup>[4]</sup>, but I’m bringing this up because I
    distinctly<sup>[5]</sup> remember an offhand comment that someone
    made at that workshop. The comment was that it’s unfair that
    experimentalists get to write things like “<a

    soup</a> that calls itself molecular neuroscience, I was
    <em>awed</em> by my colleagues, who appeared to be fluent in
    speaking p̴͓̂͘á̴̻͌s̶̻̗͋͑ṯ̸̹̈́̌à̶̳. It took me a year or two to figure out that they
    also do not know what most of the terms mean - and for most
    abbreviations, there are only a handful of people in the world who
    <em>can</em> decode them. But nobody likes to <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes">acknowledge
    that they don’t know what things mean publicly</a>. Therefore
    everybody nods along when they read Ǫ̵͎͊G̶̦̉̇l̶͉͇̝̽͆̚i̷͔̓̏͌c̷̱̙̍̂͜k̷̠͍͌l̷̢̍͗̃n̷̖͇̏̆å̴̤c̵̲̼̫͑̎̆. So it’s fine if you
    don’t know what it means. Almost nobody does<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">

    <p>A colleague of mine points out that she reads this as: “[pathway
    I don’t work on] is affected by [protein I don’t work on]”. I guess
    that’s fine, and perhaps it even represents some optimal trade-off
    between conciseness and information content for some people. I’m
    just pointing out that most people don’t know that there is no
    secret society of “initiated people” who can read all those titles
    and know what they mean.</p>

    <p><strong>Argument from interestingness.</strong></p>
    <p>BDNF has shown up repeatedly in the rationality-sphere over the
    last years:</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>Alexey Guzey’s thesis about <a
    href="https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/">why you</a><em><a
    href="https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/">shouldn’t</a></em><a
    href="https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/">sleep</a> circles around
    BDNF.</p></li>
    <li><p>Natália Mendonça’s counter-thesis that you <em><a

    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sbcmACvB6DqYXYidL/counter-theses-on-sleep">sleep
    all the time</a> attacks Guzey’s claims about BDNF.</p></li>
    <li><p>Scott Alexander <a
    href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/13/what-is-depression-anyway-the-synapse-hypothesis/">explained
    a few years ago</a> how an increase in BDNF plays a central role in
    the function of antidepressants.</p></li>
    <li><p>Then there was a <a
    href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2821%2900077-5">big
    Cell paper</a> that argued for the importance of the canonical BDNF
    receptor (TrkB) rather than BDNF. Scott <a
    href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/a-look-down-track-b?s=r">didn’t
    buy it</a>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>But that is just the tip of the iceberg! Let’s check out what we
    can find on Spotify about BDNF.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_103.png" /></p>
    <p>Faster learning, better memory, neurogenesis, stopping
    Alzheimer’s. Also, some playlists that will boost your BDNF!</p>
    <p>What about YouTube?</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_104.png" /></p>
    <p>More boosting brainpower, fighting anxiety, naturally increasing
    BDNF through workout…</p>
    <p>Hopefully, all of your <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/via-productiva?s=w#:~:text=Don%27t%20listen%20to%20Cassandra.">alarm
    bells</a> are going off right now. This pattern-matches with scams
    and <a
    href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/">irreplicability</a>.
    Cognitive enhancement would be a <a
    href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics">huge deal</a>, but it’s also
    super <a
    href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/algernon/2011-lynch.pdf">difficult,</a>
    and apart from maybe coffee and modafinil, there don’t appear to be
    any easy hacks.</p>
    <p>But why do (some) people <em>believe</em> BDNF can do all these
    things? There are so many words in p̴͓̂͘á̴̻͌s̶̻̗͋͑ṯ̸̹̈́̌à̶̳; why pick BDNF in
    particular? Why are there no playlists about Ǫ̵͎͊G̶̦̉̇l̶͉͇̝̽͆̚i̷͔̓̏͌c̷̱̙̍̂͜k̷̠͍͌l̷̢̍͗̃n̷̖͇̏̆å̴̤c̵̲̼̫͑̎̆ improving
    your mental faculties?</p>
    <p><strong>Argument from academic street cred.</strong></p>
    <p>A partial answer to that question comes directly when we open
    Google Scholar and search for BDNF.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_105.png" />A
    semi-random selection of BDNF papers from the first page of Google
    Scholar.</p>
    <p>If you happen to be doing neuroscience research in the 90s and
    you are looking for a hot topic to research - BDNF is your
    fast-track ticket to tenure<sup>[8]</sup>. Considering that the
    “normal” citation count for a paper in a top journal like Nature is
    “<a
    href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/about/journal-metrics">only”
    in the double digits</a>, and a lot of papers <a
    href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/23/academic-papers-citation-rates-remler">never
    get cited at all</a>, it is pretty insane that you have to go to
    page <em>14</em> on Google Scholar after searching”BDNF” to find a
    paper with less than 100 citations<sup>[9]</sup>.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[8] </p>
    <p>Also, consider telling Hugh Hefner about his death date. He’ll
    probably find a way to make good use of his remaining time.</p>

    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[9] </p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_117.png" />And
    this one was published only last… wait.. oh no. When did that
    happen?</p>
    </div>
    <p>Other signaling molecules pale in comparison:</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>glutamate; first sub-100 citations paper on page 9</p></li>
    <li><p>GABA; first sub-100 citations paper on page 4</p></li>
    <li><p>dopamine; first sub-100 citations paper on page 3</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Calling BDNF a “big deal” in neuroscience would be an
    understatement. In the literature, it’s called “<a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1078">A convergence point
    for many signaling pathways</a>“, “<a
    href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00363/full">A
    Key Molecule for Memory in the Healthy and the Pathological
    Brain</a>“, and “<a
    href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10571-017-0510-4">A
    Key Factor with Multipotent Impact on Brain Signaling and Synaptic
    Plasticity</a>”.</p>
    <p>The fact that there is so much research on BDNF also hints at why
    there should be so much questionable content on Spotify and YouTube.
    We should expect the <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/via-productiva?s=w#:~:text=Don%27t%20listen%20to%20Cassandra.">noise
    to scale with the signal</a> - the more research there is, the
    easier it is to pick out individual pieces and spin an arbitrary
    narrative. But this should not <em>a priori</em> mean that the
    underlying science is bad! <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_healing">Quantum
    healing</a> does not invalidate quantum physics.</p>
    <p>Then again, <a
    href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244019829575">citations
    are not a good proxy for quality,</a> and especially articles in <a
    href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020885">medicine-adjacent
    fields suffer from citation inflation</a>. And as a lot of
    literature on BDNF comes from those fields, they might have <a
    href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/">replicability
    issues</a>. So, just because there are many highly-cited papers, we
    can’t necessarily conclude that the underlying research is
    solid.</p>
    <p><strong>Argument from ubiquity.</strong></p>
    <p>So let us zoom out instead and (try to) take an unbiased look.
    From a <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-context-and-people?s=w">previous
    project,</a> I happen to have a 2D embedding of all the neuroscience
    papers published on biorxiv:</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_106.png" />Zoom
    in on the neuroscience section of biorxiv (red) from a tSNE
    embedding of all papers on biorxiv. Superimposed are the projected
    embeddings of three famous neuroscientists and yours truly.</p>
    <p>This embedding is useful for understanding <em>where/in which
    subcommunity</em> certain topics are being researched. In
    particular, for any given keyword, we can compute the semantic
    similarity with all the papers:</p>
    <pre><code>corpus_embeddings = get_papers(&#39;neuroscience&#39;)
serotonin_embedding = model.encode(&quot;Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)&quot;)
util.cos_sim(corpus_embeddings, serotonin_embedding)</code></pre>
    <p>We can use the resulting similarity scores to color in a tSNE
    embedding of all the neuroscience papers.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_107.png" />TSNE
    embedding of all preprints published in the neuroscience section of
    biorxiv. Embedding computed with the <a
    href="https://github.com/allenai/specter">Allen SPECTER model</a>.
    The color indicates semantic similarity with serotonin (left),
    glutamate (middle), or BDNF (right).</p>
    <p>BDNF makes the neuroscience landscape <a
    href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/dbc520a9-9a06-4eba-8c3b-c6c0ad1ea3a3">light
    up like a Christmas tree</a><sup>[10]</sup>! Almost all areas of
    neuroscience that are represented on biorxiv appear to have active
    research related to BDNF. Postulating that all the subfields of
    neuroscience conspire to do shoddy science on BDNF is probably a bit
    much.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[10] </p>
    <p>I didn’t expect to see such a strong difference (glutamate and
    serotonin are also kind of important), so perhaps there is some bias
    in how the SPECTER model computes the embedding of the string
    “Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)”. (Also, this is totally
    not how the SPECTER model is supposed to be used.) Or perhaps it’s
    because BDNF is comparatively “new”, i.e. only discovered 40 years
    ago?</p>
    </div>
    <p>So I conclude that there is <em>some</em> true signal in all the
    noise. That’s rather fortunate<sup>[11]</sup> for me since it means
    that the time I already spent <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23557-3#:~:text=an%20activity%2Ddependent-,neurotrophin,-model">working
    on this</a> is not (completely) wasted. Let’s see if we can unpack
    this further and separate the fluff from the science.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[11] </p>
    <p>or overly convenient?</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="exposition">Exposition</h2>
    <p>It’s 1982<sup>[12]</sup>, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Thoenen">and you are</a> a
    Swiss-born neurobiologist<sup>[13]</sup> who finds himself as the
    director of the Max-Planck Institute for Psychiatry<sup>[14]</sup>
    established only 5 years earlier. During your childhood in the Swiss
    mountainside, you would not have expected to find yourself in a
    laboratory, cooled down to 4°, containing several refrigerators
    filled with pig brains and a blender; but here you are. Together
    with <a

    <p>Yves-Alain Barde and Hans Thoenen had searched for BDNF by
    purifying it from pig brains. It’s present in very low quantities,
    so it took them a while to find it. But they reasoned that there
    <em>should</em> be an analog of the nerve growth factor (NGF) that
    was <a

    for survival of peripheral neurons</a>, so they kept searching until
    they found it<sup>[15]</sup>. After this initial discovery, it <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/341149a0">took seven years</a>
    for them to deduce the amino acid sequence and produce BDNF in

    is actually NGF, but all the neurotrophins are pretty similar. <a
    href="https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/68">source</a></p>
    <p>People got excited about BDNF in the first place because it <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2697237/">keeps neurons
    alive</a> and <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12441056/">makes synapses
    stronger</a>. Turns out neurons are little divas: when you put too
    many (or too few, or without <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia">their cheerleaders</a>) of
    them in a dish, they <a
    href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why-are-my-primary-rat-neuronal-cultures-dying-at-around-14-days">just
    die</a>. A stroke (a reduction in blood supply to a part of the
    brain) really wouldn’t be so bad if it didn’t <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19182083/">kill a ton of
    neurons in the process</a>. And what Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s,
    Huntington’s, etc., have in common is that their behavioral
    phenotype is <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease">brought
    about mostly by neural death</a>. Naturally, researchers hoped they
    could convince neurons not to do that if offered enough BDNF. (After
    tons of animal testing, the phase 1 trial of administering BDNF to
    people affected by Alzheimer’s disease <a
    href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05040217">started in
    2021</a>.)</p>
    <p>This is not the end of the story, though. If you’ve been living
    in this universe for a while, you will have realized that there can
    be no Sherlock without a Moriarty. <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8603699/">Seven years after
    BDNF could be cloned in sufficient quantity</a>, we finally got a
    solid understanding of how BDNF is produced in the brain: similar to
    other neurotrophins, it’s synthesized as a precursor (preproBDNF),
    which is then processed by an enzyme into an immature version of
    BDNF (proBDNF) and then finally into mature BDNF.</p>

    While proBDNF preferentially binds to a receptor that promotes
    synaptic depression and cell death, BDNF preferentially binds to a

    <p>Initially, people <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0209-105">were a bit

    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15930396/">it kills them</a>.
    Instead of making synapses stronger, it <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19451278/">makes them
    weaker</a>. And yet, as if stars of a sitcom, both proBDNF and BDNF
    have to live cramped together in synaptic vesicles. (Surprisingly, I
    could not find any phase 1 trial of administering proBDNF to people
    who are too healthy.)</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_111.png" />Both
    proBDNF and BDNF are packed tightly into vesicles, ready to be
    released into the synaptic cleft. Alongside the neurotrophins, there
    are also cleaving proteases in the vesicle that can turn proBDNF
    into BDNF. Adapted from <a
    href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1803645115">source</a>.</p>
    <p>While BDNF initially was only found in brain smoothies that are
    not doing much of anything anymore, it soon became clear that <a
    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5479144/">neural
    activity can modulate neurotrophin concentration</a>. The first hint
    came from the fact that mRNA for neurotrophins increases <a
    href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.2549634">after
    seizures,</a> but soon people were able to tease apart more closely
    that activity-dependent release of BDNF is <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12553913/">important for
    retaining memories</a>. And now we’re even getting to the point
    where we can stimulate individual synapses with a laser and <a

    good. Neurons contain BDNF, which brings about good things, and its

    fires, we get some additional BDNF. But <em>how</em> does BDNF bring
    about good things? I’m glad you ask.</p>

    <p>Now, this is… different. Certainly a lot less pretty. And
    importantly, we have exchanged the territory for a
    map<sup>[20]</sup>. We lost information about spatial scales and how
    <em>dense</em> everything is. But we have gained arrows! Suppose we
    trust the authors<sup>[21]</sup> to have done their literature
    research properly. In that case, we might now feel compelled to make
    statements like “ <em>Extracellular BDNF binds to the TrkB receptor
    and triggers the PLC-γ-mediated activation of IP3, which in turn
    contributes to intracellular calcium release. An increase in
    postsynaptic calcium triggers exocytosis of BDNF into the synaptic
    cleft, where it binds to pre-and postsynaptic TrkB receptors,
    kicking off further signaling cascades</em> ”. And just like that,

    <p>A definition of “understanding” I like is “being able to predict

    misunderstand (below chance performance), and you can grok something
    (near 100% performance).</p>
    </div>
    <p>Don’t worry if you didn’t get that summary of BDNF action; I
    don’t get it either. A picture at this level might help us if we
    want to <strong>roughly predict</strong><sup>[22]</sup> how a defect
    in one thing might affect other things - we can just follow the
    arrows. And it might inspire us to hunt for new connections between
    things that we didn’t know about - can we add an arrow
    somewhere?</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[22] </p>
    <p>We probably won’t be able to <strong>predict</strong> what
    happens <strong>precisely</strong>. The diagram is almost guaranteed
    to be missing some arrows, and removing an arrow will probably
    result in the addition of new arrows (the brain is <a

    activation leads to the release of glutamate into the synaptic
    cleft. Glutamate binds to postsynaptic receptors and triggers an
    influx of calcium. Calcium, in turn, brings about the release of
    BDNF into the synaptic cleft. BDNF binds to pre- and postsynaptic
    receptors, which prompts an increase in presynaptic glutamate stores
    and the insertion of additional postsynaptic glutamate receptors.

    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>When I saw (a variation) of this picture for the first time, it
    made sense that there should be BDNF receptors in the <em>pre</em>
    synapse. Diffusion of BDNF from the <em>post</em> synapse back to
    the <em>pre</em> synapse could be a kind of “read receipt”,
    indicating that signal transmission went fine<sup>[29]</sup>. But
    why would there also be BDNF receptors in the <em>post</em> synapse?
    The postsynapse already “ <em>knows</em> ” that it just released
    BDNF. Why would you <em>build</em> something like this?</li>
    <li>And, if BDNF is just overall awesome and stops your neurons from
    dying, why doesn’t your brain push the “more BDNF” button <em>all
    the time</em>? There must be trade-offs. Perhaps you don’t want
    <em>way</em> <em>too</em> <em>much</em> BDNF. Still, if BDNF has all
    the magical abilities from the introduction (better hair, fantastic
    baritone voice, the ability to jump 3 meters high), then evolution
    ought to have figured out a way to crank up the natural production
    of BDNF.</li>
    <li>And finally: how does this relate to <em>everything else</em>?

    <p>Resolving this type of confusion is not straightforward. Here are
    some possible non-answers:</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>Sometimes the error is in the map - perhaps the experiments that
    indicate BDNF receptors in the postsynapse are just
    bad<sup>[30]</sup>?</li>
    <li>Sometimes you don’t look at the map carefully enough, and the
    confusion comes from poor understanding.</li>
    <li>Sometimes there is no answer. Evolution is just <a

    </ol>
    <p>I’m still unsure what the answers to these questions are, and I
    have a good bit of probability mass on the three non-answers
    above<sup>[31]</sup>. There is, however, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=966&amp;v=1bSPNboKCzM&amp;feature=youtu.be">another
    way of looking at this</a>.</p>

    <p>One simple explanation for why there are receptors in the
    postsynapse would be that since there is also presynaptic release of
    BDNF (which I just left out of the simplified schematic), the
    postsynaptic receptors just detect that.</p>

While there haven’t been any papers arguing against the importance of proBDNF in the last decade, most of the recent supporting literature comes from a few research groups, and I’ve met some people at conferences who were skeptical of the whole story. So beware and mark this section with the appropriate amount of uncertainty._</code></pre>
    <p>As proBDNF and BDNF are packed together into the same vesicle, we
    might expect them to be released into the synaptic cleft together.
    And indeed, there is <a
    href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1207767109">some</a> <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19147841/">evidence</a> of
    proBDNF in the synaptic cleft following neural activity. So
    effectively, neural activity tells a synapse <strong>both</strong>
    to get stronger (BDNF signaling) and to get weaker (proBDNF
    signaling). It’s like <a
    href="https://youtu.be/K_DcOWDOETo?t=218">holding the gas and brake
    pedal at once.</a></p>

    <p>What is going on here? Has the brain lost its
    mind<sup>[33]</sup>? Well, maybe. But an alternative explanation
    comes from the fact that <strong><a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19147841/">the processing of
    proBDNF into BDNF can also happen in extracellular
    space</a></strong>. If we were to anthropomorphize the situation, we
    might say: The postsynapse makes a <em>best guess</em> at whether it
    should become stronger or weaker and releases proBDNF and BDNF into
    the synaptic cleft in accordance. Then, the
    <strong>presynapse</strong> makes corrections to this best guess by
    <strong>differentially processing some amount of proBDNF into
    BDNF</strong>.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">

    Interactions between neurotrophins (BDNF and proBDNF), neurotrophin
    receptors (TrkB and P75NTR), and cleaving protease (MMP9). Bottom:
    Outcome of synaptic stimulation where two synapses separated by a
    distance d innervate the same dendrite: I. The left synapse is
    stimulated with a burst of action potentials. II. Presynaptic
    activation causes the local release of MMP9 (yellow). III. Signal
    transduction into the postsynapse results in the spatially extended
    calcium influx (purple shading). Calcium triggers the exocytosis of
    proBDNF (orange) and BDNF (green) into extracellular space. IV. MMP9
    differentially cleaves proBDNF into BDNF at the stimulated synapse.
    V. Repeating this pattern of stimulation potentiates the stimulated
    synapse and depresses the unstimulated synapse (arrows). <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23557-3#Fig1">source</a></p>
    <p>MMP9 here is just a type of cleaving enzyme (represented by a
    scissor in the illustration in an earlier section). Notice how, even
    though <strong>both</strong> synapses initially released proBDNF and
    BDNF in an equal amount, only <strong>one</strong> synapse gets
    larger. The important difference is that only one of the two
    synapses has the cleaving enzyme.</p>
    <p>This particular <a
    href="http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/classes/nbio143/Papers/Neurotrophins/Lu05.pdf">framing
    of neurotrophin interaction</a> is fascinating to me, and I’ve spent
    some portion of my doctoral research thinking about how far we can
    push this interplay of activity and molecular balance to <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23557-3#Fig1">establish
    structure in the developing brain</a><sup>[34]</sup>. In particular,
    this framing provides several elegant answers to the questions I
    have raised throughout this essay:</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[34] </p>
    <p>As a good rationalist, I am of course not resting all of my
    research on this one (potentially shaky) assumption. After setting
    up a dynamical system of neurotrophin interactions, I immediately
    demonstrate how <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23557-3#:~:text=to%20each%20other.-,Generalized%20neurotrophin%2Dinspired%20model,-We%20reduced%20the">we
    can reduce it</a> to a simpler system that is ubiquitous in
    computational neuroscience.</p>
    </div>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li><strong>Q</strong> : Why would there also be BDNF receptors in
    the postsynapse? <strong>A</strong> : Because sending out proBDNF
    and BDNF into the synaptic cleft is not a “read receipt”, it’s a
    probe supposed to gather information about the status of the
    presynapse! Depending on how active the presynapse has been, the <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23019376/">more cleaving
    enzyme will be around</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Q</strong> : If BDNF is overall awesome and makes your
    brain better, why doesn’t your brain push the “more BDNF” button
    <em>all the time</em>? <strong>A</strong> : Because what you want is
    not more BDNF <em>everywhere</em> equally (unless you just had a <a
    href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.2549634">seizure</a>
    or have a neurodegenerative disease). The brain’s ability to process
    information comes from the <em>selective</em> connectivity of
    different neurons. You want BDNF and proBDNF in an appropriate
    balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Q</strong> : And finally: how does this relate to
    <em>all the other signaling pathways</em> we know?
    <strong>A</strong> : The interplay of proBDNF and BDNF is
    responsible for setting up the groundwork - making sure that the
    appropriate neurons and synapses survive. But once the groundwork is
    established, the pair fades into the background and leaves the stage
    for fancier actors to refine and tune. Indeed, expression of BDNF
    and proBDNF peaks in the second postnatal week and shifts into a
    BDNF dominated regime afterward. <img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_116.png" />Hippocampal
    lysates from mice of the indicated genotype and ages were subjected
    to immunoprecipitation/western blot analysis for BDNF isoforms. <a

    </ol>
    <p>I’m pretty satisfied with these answers, but I want to stress
    again that a lot of stuff in this section is <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-not-reading-papers?s=w#:~:text=a%20paper%20adds.-,Schematic,-of%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20delta">conjecture</a>.
    “Neurotrophin balance is all you need” has explanatory power and
    meshes well with <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">known themes in
    biology,</a> but it’s important to keep in mind that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one

    causal arrows between depression ←→ more sleep ←→ more/less BDNF.
    What can we contribute to this?</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>According to the “neurotrophin balance is all you need”
    perspective, the point is moot. Unless you have some reason to
    believe that you have too little BDNF by default, you probably don’t
    even <em>want</em> more BDNF. Sleeping more or less doesn’t matter
    if you don’t know if either affects the balance in the right
    way.</li>

    but they split their sample post-hoc between smokers and

    deprivation might <em>increase</em> BDNF (they cite <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/4001897">this paper</a> which
    looks a bit more trustworthy) and that prolonged sleep deprivation
    <em>decreases</em> it. So depending on how much BDNF you want in
    your brain, you might want to …</li>
    <li>… no, but really, those papers are all kind of “meh”. I don’t
    want to slight any of my fellow researchers (I’m sure they’ve worked
    hard on this), but the results are not solid enough to conclusively
    arbitrate <em>any</em> high-level debate. Let’s wait five to ten
    years and <a
