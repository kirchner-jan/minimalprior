      pointed questions</a> about the importance of research questions and
    individual career decisions? Was he, like, <em>actually</em>
    banished from the lunch table?</p>

  </h2>
  <p>A couple of months ago I’ve started asking my colleagues during
    lunch what their definition of a “model” is. This question is
    important: our job consists of building, evaluating, and comparing
    models. I am not hoping for an Aristotelean list of necessary &amp;
    sufficient conditions, but it still appears like a good idea to
    “survey the land”. Also, admittedly, lunch can get a bit boring
    without challenging questions.</p>

    abstract drawing of a computational model. <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/clip-guided-diffusion">CGD
      generated</a>.</p>
  <p>I got a range of responses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>” <em>a description of a phenomenon from which you can reason (=
        a description you can manipulate to tell more about the phenomenon
        than you would have been able to tell without it)</em> ”</p>
    <p>” <em>It should be something like a representation of the
        modelled system without representing it completely. Perhaps most
        importantly that it preserves the causal relationships between the
        system elements without completely mapping these elements?</em>
      ”</p>
    <p>” <em>an abstraction of reality</em> ”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I also ran into this adage again and again (attributed to a
    different person every time):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>” <em>All models are false, but some are useful.</em> ”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Along similar lines, there is a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18995824/">quote</a> from the
    influential computational neuroscientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Abbott">Larry
      Abbott</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>” <em>the term ‘realistic’ model is a sociological rather than a
        scientific term.</em> ”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Alright, survey done, lunch is over. Back to…</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="in-search-of-tighter-concepts">In search of tighter
    concepts</h2>
  <p>No! I’m not satisfied. What do you mean it’s a
    <em>sociological</em> term? What do you mean they are
    <em>false</em>? Can a model have a truth value? If a model is a
    “representation” / “abstraction” / “description” then what
    <em>exactly</em> is a “representation” / “abstraction” /
    “description”? This is not some <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FwiPfF8Woe5JrzqEu/philosophy-a-diseased-discipline">idle
      philosophical nitpicking</a>, this question is <em>immediately</em>
    important. As a reviewer, I have to judge whether a model is
    <em>good</em> (enough). As a researcher, I want to build a
    <em>good</em> model. I’m not going to devote my career to building
    models if I don’t have a <em>really good</em> idea of what a model
    <em>is</em>.
  </p>
  <p>I hope you can tell from my extensive use of italicized words
    that this is a topic I am rather passionate about. If the question
    of a good model is a sociological question then it’s subject to
    trends and fads<sup>[2]</sup>. And if the term “model” is broad
    enough to fit “<a href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">detailed
      biophysical models</a>”, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-020-00001-2">abstract
      phenomenological models</a>”, “<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.438248v1.full">linear
      regression</a>” and “<a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/21/5250#F8">a cartoon in
      Figure 8</a>” under its umbrella, then it’s inevitable that our
    intuitive understanding of what constitutes a good model deviates.
    Heck, the term is so broad, technically even this should
    qualify:</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[2] </p>
    <p>And it’s usually up to an influential “ingroup” to decide what
      fits in and what doesn’t.</p>

      questions</a>, here goes my attempt of laying out what I think of
    when I think of models. This is obviously not authoritative and it’s
    far from rigorous. This is just my “working definition” which I
    wrote down to force myself to tighten my terminology.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="mathematical-logic-to-the-rescue">Mathematical logic to the
    rescue</h2>
  <p>Since we mean so many different things by the term “model” it
    makes sense to start very general, i.e. mathematical. There is
    indeed a subfield of mathematics called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory">model theory</a>”
    that makes some very useful distinctions! I’ll trample over all
    subtleties to get to the core quickly, but consider checking out <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MG8Yhsxqu9JY4xRPr/mental-context-for-model-theory">this</a>
    or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SqFbMbtxGybdS2gRs/p/Z2CuyKtkCmWGQtAEh">this</a>
    for accessible introductory reading.</p>
  <p>Here goes the central definition:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A model is a (mathematical) object that satisfies all the
      sentences of a theory.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To make this useful, we have to further define the used
    terms.</p>
  <p>What is a <em>theory</em>? It’s a set of sentences. What is a
    <em>sentence</em>? Well, it’s pretty much what you would expect -
    it’s a string of symbols constructed from an alphabet according to
    some fixed rules. A famous example of a theory is <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms#First-order_theory_of_arithmetic">Peano
      arithmetic</a>, but really the definition is much more general:
  </p>
  <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>A dynamical system, given as a set of differential
      equations<sup>[3]</sup>, is a theory.</li>
    <li>A cellular automaton, given as a set of transition rules, is a
      theory.</li>
    <li>Any recursively enumerable set of sentences of a formal
      language, given as a set of production rules, is a theory.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_84.png" />An
    abstract drawing of a cellular automaton. <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/clip-guided-diffusion">CGD
      generated</a>.</p>
  <p>Now to the other part of the definition. What is a mathematical
    object? <em>Phew</em> , you are opening a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Contemporary_schools_of_thought">can
      of worms</a>… But I’m pretty sure you’ll recognize a mathematical
    object when you see it. <strong><a href="https://www.dcode.fr/number-sets">R</a></strong><a
      href="https://www.dcode.fr/number-sets">,</a><strong><a href="https://www.dcode.fr/number-sets">Q</a></strong><a
      href="https://www.dcode.fr/number-sets">,</a><strong><a href="https://www.dcode.fr/number-sets">Z,</a></strong><a
      href="https://www.dcode.fr/number-sets"></a><strong><a href="https://www.dcode.fr/number-sets">N</a></strong> ,
    and all the
    cool stuff you can build from those sets, those are mathematical
    objects. <strong>N</strong> satisfies the theory of (and is,
    therefore, a model of) Peano arithmetic. For the three theories
    mentioned above, the mathematical objects that satisfy them are:</p>
  <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>A particular trajectory through state space, f.e. specified
      through initial conditions.</li>
    <li>A particular evolution of the cellular automaton, again
      specified through the initial conditions.</li>
    <li>A particular Turing machine that implements the production
      rules, specified through… (you get the idea).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If we are allowed to be even more hand-wavy, then we can also
    incorporate models à la <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/10/model-this-5.html">Tyler
      Cowen</a>: To “model this [headline]” we have to come up with a
    theory (a set of sentences) from which the headline follows.</p>
  <p>One important thing to note here is that every model “inherits”
    every property that follows from the theory. But the inverse does
    not hold<sup>[4]</sup>: just because a model has a certain property,
    this property does not necessarily follow from the theory. In
    general, there will always be multiple models that satisfy a theory,
    each with different “additional properties” that go beyond what is
    prescribed by the theory<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[5] </p>
    <p>One might be tempted to argue that if many different models
      satisfy the same theory, this is evidence that the property actually
      does follow from the theory. This isn’t guaranteed, but it might
      work in some cases. In Computational Neuroscience, this is the
      practice of demonstrating that the desired result holds even when
      the parameter is slightly perturbed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[4] </p>
    <p>This inverse only holds when the model uniquely and completely
      specifies the model, which is pretty hard to achieve in principle.
      See <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3FoMuCLqZggTxoC3S/logical-pinpointing">Logical
        Pinpointing</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>All fine and well. What does this added complexity buy us?</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="good-models-bad-models">Good models, bad models</h2>
  <p>Defining a model as an object satisfying a theory is broad enough
    to cover all the ways in which the term is used:</p>
  <ul class="incremental">
    <li>
      <p>the entire spectrum of mathematical models, from detailed
        biophysical to normative Bayesian, is specified by a set of
        equations (a theory) and instantiated with parameter
        choices.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the “cartoon in Figure 8” is one particular (rather
        toothless) object that satisfies an implicit theory (consisting of a
        set of conjectured sentences).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the albatross fashion model… doesn’t fit. But <a
          href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5f5r2N4Lp9WoULWPH9zp2W?si=b2d7dec6f9da4884">you
          can’t have everything, I’m told</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>It also includes an interesting pathological case: to model a
    particular set of observations, we could just come up with a theory
    that contains all the observations as axioms, but no production
    rules. Then the observations themselves trivially satisfy the
    theory. This is clearly useless in some sense<sup>[6]</sup> (a
    dataset shouldn’t be a model?) - but looking deeper into why it’s
    useless reveals something about what constitutes a <em>good</em>
    model - or, by extension, a <em>good</em> theory.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[6] </p>
    <p>This has some overlap with Chomsky’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levels_of_adequacy">levels of
        adequacy</a>: a theory that includes only the observations as axioms
      has observational adequacy, but neither descriptive nor explanatory
      adequacy.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Here is my definition:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A <em>good</em> model of a phenomenon is one that allows us to
      <em>understand</em> something about the phenomenon. If all the
      models of a theory are good models, the theory is a <em>good</em>
      theory.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Again, we need to define our terms for this to make sense. What
    is a <em>phenomenon</em>? A phenomenon is some (conjunction of)
    physical process(es). It’s something <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KJ9MFBPwXGwNpadf2/skill-the-map-is-not-the-territory">out
      there in the territory</a>. What does <em>understand</em> mean?
    Understanding a phenomenon means predicting (better than chance
    level) the state of the phenomenon at time <strong>t+1</strong>
    given the state at time <strong>t</strong>.</p>
  <p>Why does it make sense to set up things like this?</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="models-with-benefits">Models with benefits</h2>
  <p>First, it establishes a neat hierarchy. Understanding is gradual:
    It goes from non-existing (chance level) to poor (consistently above
    chance<sup>[7]</sup>) to great (almost perfect prediction) to
    complete (100% prediction accuracy).</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[7] </p>
    <p>Or below, of course! If you’re consistently worse than chance
      that is very useful information.</p>
  </div>
  <p>With this definition, a “black box” deep learning model that is
    able to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/133504v1.full">predict
      a percentage of brain activity</a> does provide <em>some</em>
    understanding about a part of the brain. Similarly, a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean-field_theory">mean-field
      model</a> that has “lost” some conversion factor in its units can
    also still be a good model, as long as it is able to get the
    <em>direction</em> of the evolution of the state correct.
  </p>
  <p>Second, by making “predictions” the central criterion for the
    model quality we avoid unproductive <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions">disputes
      resulting from mismatched terms</a>. The usual example here is “If a
    tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?”, which can lead to
    a highly unproductive discussion if asked at the lunch table. But
    when explanations are evaluated according to their predictive power,
    misunderstandings are resolved quickly: Either a tape recorder will
    or won’t record airwaves. Either there is or there isn’t activation
    in some auditory cortex.</p>
  <p>Third, to have a good theory, you need to demonstrate that all
    its models are good (according to the definition above). This gets
    naturally easier if there are fewer models that satisfy the theory,
    thus incentivizing you to remove as many free parameters from the
    theory as possible<sup>[8]</sup>. Ideally, you’ll want a unique
    characterization of a good model from your theory.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[8] </p>
    <p>Thus we arrive at an interesting version of Occam’s razor.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Finally, this definition formalizes the “all models are wrong,
    but some are useful” adage. To get 100% prediction accuracy for a
    physical process you have to go down to the level of particles. F.e.
    having a fluid dynamics model of water motion will get you very far
    in terms of predictive power. In that sense, it’s a very good model.
    But to get even close to 100%, you’ll want an <a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html">atomic
      model of water</a>. And eventually, if you are pushing for ever more
    predictive power, you’ll have to decompose your problem further and
    further, and eventually, you will get into very weird
    territory<sup>[9]</sup>.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[9] </p>
    <p>Let’s not talk about quantum stuff on this Substack, okay?</p>

      generated</a>.</p>
  <p>Thus, to determine whether a model is good or bad, you have to
    figure out which phenomenon it is trying to explain and then
    determine if the model allows you to predict the time-evolution of
    the phenomenon better than chance level. This is a relatively low
    bar, but in my experience, it’s still not easy to clear. Actually
    demonstrating that your performance is different from chance
    requires explicit performance metrics, which are not usually
    adapted. But that’s <a href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-scaling-academia">a
      different story</a>.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="cliffhanger">Cliffhanger!</h2>
  <p>This is almost all I wanted to say on the topic. But I glossed
    over an important point in that exposition: If a model is a
    mathematical object, why might we expect that it can predict
    physical processes <em>out there in the territory</em>? In fact, why
    should there be <em>any</em> similarity between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model">solar system
      and the
      atom</a><sup>[10]</sup>? Why does <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-analogy/">analogical
      reasoning</a> work?</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[10] </p>
    <p>Yes, I know that the Bohr model is not the end of the story. But
      it is still able to explain basically all of chemistry. And also ”
