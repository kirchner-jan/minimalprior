  <p>Over the Christmas holiday, I became slightly obsessed with the
    Netflix show “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81026300">Next
      in Fashion</a>.” It’s (probably) only a temporary obsession, nothing
    to worry about. But before I move on to the next obsession, I wanted
    to take a moment to write up what I learned<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[1] </p>
    <p>in the blogging space as writing about <a
        href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/elementary-infra-bayesianism">Infrabayesianism</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>Buckle up, this will be a weird one.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl.png" /></p>
  <p>Before I get into the nitty-gritty of my newfound interest in
    fashion, let me first address the elephant in the room - why care
    about fashion in the first place<sup>[2]</sup>?</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[2] </p>
    <p>Isn’t the whole point of moving to the Bay so that you
      <em>don’t</em> have to care about what you are wearing?
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2 id="why-fashion">Why fashion</h2>
  <p>There are three different schools<sup>[3]</sup> of thought on the
    question.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[3] </p>
    <p>That I had the patience to spell out</p>
  </div>
  <p><em>School of the devil</em> : The philosophy of “<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film)">The
      Devil Wears Prada</a>”<sup>[4]</sup> is centered around the idea
    that fashion is a form of power and influence. The film explores the
    idea that the fashion industry is a demanding and competitive field
    that requires a high level of expertise and commitment, and that
    subverting the rigid hierarchy of fashion can have unintended or
    unexpected consequences.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[4] </p>
    <p>alright, perhaps my obsession was not limited to a Netflix
      show</p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_1.png" /></p>
  <p><em>School of the barber pole</em> : Scott Alexander’s <a
      href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/">barber
      pole model</a> posits that fashion trends move in a predictable
    cycle, with each new trend allowing elites to distinguish themselves
    from runner-ups (who take a while to catch up). An important
    prediction of this model is that fashion worn by the “upper” class
    can end up looking a lot like fashion worn by the “lower” class, who
    tend to pick up on trends at a time delay. As such, fashion is
    primarily a vehicle for signaling social status and group
    membership.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_2.png" /></p>
  <p><em>School of reality TV</em> : While never spelled out
    explicitly, in “Next in Fashion” fashion is a form of creative
    expression and a way to appreciate art. The show centers around the
    skill and talent required to create unique and innovative designs,
    and the importance of supporting and nurturing new talent in the
    industry. In this interpretation, fashion can also help us better
    understand ourselves, each other, and the world we live in.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_3.png" /></p>
  <h2 id="why-im-not-buying-it">Why I’m not buying it</h2>
  <p>But none of these explanations are quite satisfying (or even
    mutually exclusive). Let’s put them under the microscope one by
    one.</p>
  <h5 id="is-fashion-a-form-of-power-and-influence">Is fashion a form
    of <em>power and influence</em>?</h5>
  <p>Let’s start with numbers: Global revenue from luxury apparel <a
      href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/luxury-goods/luxury-fashion/luxury-apparel/worldwide">comes
      in at US$82.30bn</a>, which is a so-called <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-scaling-academia#:~:text=).%20Those%20are-,not%2Dsmall%20numbers,-%2C%20but%20they%20pale">not-insignificant-number</a>.
    <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/13/elo-musk-no-longer-world-richest-person-net-worth-drop/">Thanks
      to the bird app</a>, the richest person on earth is now the CEO of
    the world’s largest luxury goods company<sup>[5]</sup>.
  </p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[5] </p>
    <p>with luxury clothing <a
        href="https://r.lvmh-static.com/uploads/2022/07/lvmh_interim-financial-report-2022.pdf">producing
        the largest share of the revenue</a></p>
  </div>
  <p>Is that actually a big deal? Whenever I see large numbers, I do
    my best to put them into perspective:</p>
  <ul class="incremental">
    <li>
      <p>$80 billion is a fair bit more than the <a
          href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/8/23150496/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-dustin-moskovitz-billionaire-philanthropy-crytocurrency">˜US$20bn
          behind effective altruism charities</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>$80 billion <em>might</em> be enough to finance <a
          href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/California_High-Speed_Rail#:~:text=cost%20estimates%20to-,complete,-the%20entire%20Phase">Phase
          I of the California High-Speed Rail system</a> or <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/agency">one of the
          smaller
          departments of the state</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>$80 billion is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/">0.08%
          of the global GDP</a> - do with that information whatever you
        like.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fashion moves money, more so today than yesterday. Classic
    economic theory is not surprised by that fact, as it literally
    defines luxury goods as those goods for which “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/luxury-item.asp">demand
      increases when a person’s wealth or income increases</a>”. As things
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature">generally-tend-to-get-better</a>™,
    we can expect that (by definition) the amount spent on luxury
    goods<sup>[6]</sup> should continue to increase.
  </p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[6] </p>
    <p>Whatever that might mean in the future.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Unfortunately, this “truth by definition” also makes the insight
    vacuous. My question is exactly <em>why</em> luxury clothing is
    desirable. <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/reverse-causality/">Fashion
      implies power, not the other way around</a>. What <em>makes</em> a
    luxury item luxurious?</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_4.png" /></p>
  <h5 id="is-fashion-all-about-signaling-and-the-slow-cyclical-propagation-of-status-markers-through-societys-ranks">Is
    fashion all about <em>signaling</em> and the <em>slow, cyclical
      propagation of status markers through society’s ranks</em>?</h5>
  <p>There certainly is some truth to the barber pole phenomenon. When
    sources as distinct as SlateStarCodex and <a
      href="https://currentboutique.com/blogs/cravingcurrent/why-do-fashion-trends-come-back">CurrentBoutique</a>
    report the same phenomenon, <em>something</em> real is happening.
    Fashion trends <em>do</em> come back</p>
  <p>However - attributing the cyclical features of fashion to <a
      href="https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/">signaling
      games</a> is… kind of just one possible explanation<sup>[7]</sup>?
    And not even a particularly good one, considering that the bigger
    part of society doesn’t stand in front of their wardrobe thinking
    about which social class they belong to. The signaling game might
    still emerge subconsciously (?<sup>[8]</sup>), but the
    CurrentBoutique article comes up with a bunch of alternative
    explanations that don’t require the collaboration of the subliminal.
    An observation like “TikTokers are raiding their parent’s closets”
    can explain cyclicality while being well-supported by <a
      href="https://www.tiktok.com/@greta_rolli/video/6833432906342337798?lang=en">evidence</a>.
    No need for a conspiracy and unspoken signaling games.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[7] </p>
    <p>Scott probably wouldn’t object. His B-plot with the <a
        href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/">cellular
        automata</a> and the fashion is just a set-up for writing about
      politics - something I will never do! So there’s no territorial
      dispute here.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[8] </p>
    <p>I’m not even sure what <a
        href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/frankfurt-declaration-on-the-cambridge?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web">consciousness
        is supposed to mean</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind">unconscious</a>
      is certainly above my paygrade.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Beyond the objection that <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-fussell-on-class">signaling
      games are kind of lame</a><sup>[9]</sup>, saying “fashion is cyclic”
    doesn’t explain everything there is to explain. Importantly, fashion
    doesn’t <em>exactly</em> repeat, each time around.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[9] </p>
    <p>See, Scott is not above poking fun at the intrinsic cringiness of
      signaling games.</p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_5.png" />From
    pure function, via tight and then baggy fits, all the way to
    men-sitting-on-appliances. Superficially similar, but higher-order
    terms <em>do</em> matter.</p>
  <p>While the general cuts of fashion tend to return in some form or
    other, the details matter a lot! In the words of Balaji, <a
      href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1438138118440321032">all
      progress is along the z-axis</a>. Bell bottoms keep returning, but
    <em>something</em> evolves. What is that something? Why do (some)
    people care?
  </p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_6.png" /></p>
  <h5 id="is-fashion-about-creative-self-expression-and-art-appreciation">Is
    fashion about creative self-expression and art appreciation?</h5>
  <p>This theory is actually correct. I think ‘fashion can help us
    better understand ourselves, each other, and the world we live in’
    is the true answer. People tend to buy pretty things that are
    valuable to them and they fit into the big tapestry of
    everything.</p>
  <p>I acknowledge that position is not obviously true without further
    argument. “Next in fashion” is perfectly positioned to explore this
    topic, presenting us with a team of designers bubbling over with
    passion and ambition and a total runtime of 500
    minutes<sup>[10]</sup>. I would love to recommend to you to binge it
    to learn how fashion sits at the core of everything.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[10] </p>
    <p>That’s more than 8 hours!</p>
  </div>
  <p>But it falls short of its potential<sup>[11]</sup>. Don’t get me
    wrong, the show is entertaining, jam-packed with drama and emotion,
    and a lot of pretty designs to look at for ~5 seconds each. But the
    show does not manage to penetrate the core of what draws us to
    pretty things. It only shows us that some people very clearly
    <em>are</em> drawn to it.
  </p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[11] </p>
    <p>So instead I recommend watching it as pleasant entertainment!</p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_7.png" />I
    give it 3/5 Jans.</p>
  <h2 id="what-i-did-about-it">What I did about it</h2>
  <p>So now we find ourselves at the center of my holiday
    obsession.</p>
  <p>Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when
    published</p>
  <pre><code>What makes things pretty? How do people make pretty things?</code></pre>
  <p>There is <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/empirical-aesthetics/">more</a> <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics">than</a> <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetology">one</a> field of
    academic research that is concerned with that question, but I feel
    like this type of question must be approached through experiment,
    not theory. So I aimed to fully submerge myself in the subject
    matter.</p>
  <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>
      <p>First, I read and watched everything that sparked my
        interest. The <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6510332/">McQueen documentary</a>
        was revelatory, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BlissFoster/videos">Bliss Foster</a>
        on YouTube makes insightful short video essays, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331025/">The
          September Issue</a>
        gives a more nuanced picture of the fashion industry than “The Devil
        Wears Prada”. <img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_8.png" />Why
        is there a chicken in this image you ask? <a
          href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/soldiers-scouts-and-albatrosses">Oh,
          you poor imbecile</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Second, I studied as I’d study for a test. I’m a big fan of
        <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced
          repetition</a> <a href="https://thinkstack.club/an-introduction-to-roams-delta-function-spaced-repetition/">in
          Roam Research</a> and create new cards for my system at a whim. A
        single repetition can improve recall <a
          href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#:~:text=is%20much%20superior%3A-,Wired,-(original%2C%20Wozniak%3F)%3B%20massed">dramatically</a>,
        and - check that out! - it turns out language models are really good
        at creating spaced repetition cards for you. In my experience, <a
          href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-context-and-people">learning
          about the people and movements</a> in a field can explain a ton of
        variability. <img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_9.png" />
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>I had someone quiz me. Language models are very good at that
        too, but if push comes to shove a fellow human also does the trick.
        You can even quiz them back. <img
          src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_10.png" />I
        apologize for calling you an imbecile just a moment ago, dear
        reader. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/">I apologize</a>. It’s just
        - it’s an albatross, not a chicken. Kind of a sore spot for
        me.</p>

  <h2 id="the-mechanical-anna-wintour">The Mechanical Anna
    Wintour</h2>
  <p>Despite laboring away for multiple <strong>days</strong> I still
    felt insecure about my ability to distinguish good from bad fashion.
    I <em>do</em> however feel rather secure about my ability to <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/inferring-utility-functions?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web">train
      a neural network to learn human preferences</a>. So I threw the
    experiment strategy out the window, obtained a full scrape of the <a href="https://archive.vogue.com/">Vogue
      Archive</a>, performed
    object detection to get cutouts of all the outfits, and embedded the
    cutouts in a semantic vector space with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/clip">CLIP</a>.
  </p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_11.png" />Some
    kids cut out their favorite outfits from magazines they bought with
    their lunch money, other kids scrape the vogue archive to get
    cutouts of all outfits since 1892. You say potato, I say tomato. (I
    stole that joke from a student of mine).</p>
  <p>I then recycled code from <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/inferring-utility-functions?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web">an
      old project</a> and set up a small interface for making judgment
    calls and storing them in a <a href="https://redis.io/">database</a>.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_12.png" /></p>
  <p>After <del>forcing</del> kindly asking<sup>[12]</sup> my
    significant other to make a measly 1000 comparisons<sup>[13]</sup>,
    I threw the comparisons into a neural network and trained a reward
    model. I then ranked the entire dataset and create a montage of the
    top 15 images.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[12] </p>
    <p>Her taste is by far more refined than mine!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[13] </p>
    <p>Time flies when you are having fun.</p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-medias3amazonawscom2Fpubl_13.png" />The
    reward model clearly learned <em>something</em>.</p>
  <p>I am happy to report that she thinks the resulting montage
    captured her taste pretty well<sup>[14]</sup>. So I tried to get her
    to rate 20k additional images, but somehow her enthusiasm for that
    project diminished quite quickly.</p>
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[14] </p>
    <p>“Not a color to be seen”</p>
  </div>
  <p>I, however, am not done with this project! The small toy example
    above demonstrates that fashion sense is not something <a href="https://putanumonit.com/">unquantifiable</a>, but we
    are still
    only barely scratching the surface. What is the <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/a-brief-excursion-into-molecular#:~:text=published%20on%20biorxiv%3A-,Zoom,-in%20on%20the">shape
      of the fashion landscape</a>? Can we predict fashion trends? How
    variable is fashion taste across people, and how much of that
    variability can we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_dependence">explain
      away</a>?</p>
  <p>So I made the website public for you all to try:</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.fashionator.xyz/" class="uri">https://www.fashionator.xyz/</a></p>
  <p>All your rankings are stored in a database, so I’ll be able to do
    some fantastic data analysis soon. If you enter your email address,
    I might send you your top 15 images. And maybe a follow-up survey.
    Eventually, with sufficient data, I might be able to get to the
    bottom of what makes beautiful things beautiful. And then, perhaps,
    I could install a camera in the closet and help me pick my
    outfits…</p>
  <h2 id="closing-words">Closing words</h2>
  <p>The holidays have been over for a while, but the finishing
    touches on this project ended up taking a while. That’s a bummer
    because I would love to dive deeper into the world of fashion.
    Knocking out the fashionator app was a ton of fun, and there are so
    many things I’d like to implement:</p>
  <ul class="incremental">
    <li>
      <p>integrating a feed of design and fashion pictures, curated by
        the trained reward model,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>guide an image diffusion model with the reward model to
        generate maximally aesthetic personalized images,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>or integrate a search engine to find fashion items similar to
        those in the user’s closet.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Really, this could keep someone busy for the better part of a
    work week.</p>
  <p>On a more serious note, though, my excursion has not only
    uncovered wonders and beautiful things. The more cynical take from
    above (linking the world of fashion with power hierarchies and
    social signaling) still accurately describes one aspect of the
    truth. Obsession with fashion also produces a lot of things that are
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion">kind</a> <a
      href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091115/psychology-behind-why-people-buy-luxury-goods.asp">of</a>
    <a
      href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/syamameagher/2020/02/05/the-not-so-hidden-ethical-cost-of-fast-fashion-sneaky-sweatshops-in-our-own-backyard/?sh=58031e7325d1">ugly</a>.

  <p>I maintain that power and signaling are <em>downstream</em> of
    what makes fashion desirable<sup>[15]</sup>, but that doesn’t make
    those <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/">ugly inadequacies</a>
    not exist. Fashion is entangled with power, money, and fame; and
    thus inaccessible to anyone who doesn’t spend <a
      href="https://www.givewell.org/cost-to-save-a-life#:~:text=save%20a%20life%E2%80%94-,about,-%244%2C500%20on%20average">unreasonable</a>
    amounts of time and money.</p>

    <p>The most sought-after designs are sought after not (
      <em>only</em> ) because they communicate power, money, and fame, but
      also because these designs capture something deep about what we as
      humans care about.

  <p>There is a <a href="https://futureoflife.org/project/worldbuilding-competition/">possible
      future</a> where <a
      href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/a-quick-one-while-hes-away">everything</a>
    goes well. In that world, we might need to think about what humans
    really <em>want</em>. The thing at the core of fashion, stripped
    from power-play and signaling games, feels like it could be part of
    that<sup>[16]</sup>. Getting a bit closer to that <em>thing</em>
    made the entire excursion more than worth it for me.</p>
