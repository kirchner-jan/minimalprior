    <em>both</em> animal suffering <em>and</em> the Cambridge

    of intoxicated neuroscientists partying and signing something they
    don’t understand might have taken things too far<sup>[2]</sup>. But,

    </div>
    <p>A rift divides philosophy, with analytic philosophy (<a
    href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analysis/s6.html">a broad
    and still ramifying movement in which various conceptions of
    analysis compete and pull in different directions</a>) on one side
    and continental philosophy (a term used by analytic philosophers to
    describe what they are not) on the other. Analytic philosophy gave
    us evergreen tautologies like <a
    href="https://blog.plover.com/math/PM.html">1+1=2</a>, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_theory_of_truth">‘snow

    one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.”</a> Continental
    philosophy, in contrast, provides rich head-scratchers to ponder,
    like <a
    href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/martin_heidegger_363019">Transcendence
    constitutes selfhood</a>, <a
    href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1040416">God is, as it were,

    is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my
    reasons for them!</a>”</p>
    <p>Analytic philosophy is sometimes<a
    href="https://dailynous.com/2021/05/24/analytic-philosophys-triple-failure-of-confidence/">criticized
    for not engaging</a> with the <em>deep</em> questions, like “<a

    you ever eat insects in a restaurant?</a>”</p>
    <p>Continental philosophy is sometimes criticized for… ahem. A lot
    of things.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Large swaths of philosophy (e.g. <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_philosophy">continental</a>
    and <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_philosophy">postmodern</a>
    philosophy) often don’t even <em>try</em> to be clear, rigorous, or
    scientifically respectable. This is philosophy of the “Uncle Joe’s
    musings on the meaning of life” sort, except that it’s <a
    href="http://el-prod.baylor.edu/certain_doubts/?p=453">dressed
    up</a> in big words and long footnotes. You will occasionally
    stumble upon an <em>argument</em> , but it falls prey to <a

    categories</a> and <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/od/37_ways_that_words_can_be_wrong/">language
    confusions</a> and <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/on/reductionism/">non-natural
    hypotheses</a>. You may also stumble upon science or math, but they
    are used to ‘prove’ things <a

    to the actual scientific data or the equations used. – <a

    </blockquote>
    <p>That is a harsh assessment, but it comes from someone I have
    previously <a

    for his ability for nuance</a>, so make of that whatever you
    want.</p>
    <p>One cynical explanation (that I will take way too seriously in
    this essay) for the convoluted writing style of continental
    philosophers is that they do not have the mental machinery to
    express their ideas in a formal language like mathematics.
    <strong>Perhaps many of the things continental philosophers are
    trying to express are only ideas from undergraduate-level
    maths.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="hegels-dialectic"><strong>Hegel’s dialectic</strong></h2>
    <p>“Dialectic” is not too hard to explain. The word <a
    href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/dialectic">comes from</a> the
    old greek “dialegesthai,” which means “discourse” or “conversation”.
    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel-dialectics/">SEP
    defines it as</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that
    involves some sort of contradictory process between opposing
    sides.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The most well-known instances of “dialectics” are perhaps the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue">Socratic
    dialogues</a>, where through a series of back-and-forth arguments,
    Socrates helps his interlocutor refine their philosophical
    views.</p>
    <p>Now, what is <em>Hegel’s</em> dialectic<sup>[5]</sup>? Someone on
    Quora asks, “<a
    href="https://www.quora.com/Could-someone-explain-Hegelian-dialectics-in-simple-terms-particularly-negation">Could
    someone explain Hegelian dialectics in simple terms, particularly
    negation?</a>”. The top answer runs 1500 words, introduces
    “triplicity”, “being-for-itself vs. being-in-itself”, and
    “being-a-thing-on-the-floor”, and uses words like “unexplicated”,
    “originary”, and “sublation”.</p>

    me a summary of that summary</a>, and the result is pretty
    impressive:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The dialectic is a moving soul of further development where
    things are related to each other in threes. The first part of the
    three is the in-itself, the second is the for-itself, and the third
    is the unity of the first two terms, the in-and-for-itself. This is
    the developmental path that truth must submit itself to, to realize
    or explicate itself.<sup>[6]</sup></p>
    <div class="sidenote">

    <p>If <a

    can suffer</a>, I would not be surprised if summarizing Hegel
    induces some non-negligible amount of suffering.</p>
    </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Still, total gibberish, but at least very compact gibberish. But
    what I’m getting is that Hegel’s dialectic is a process for finding
    the truth that occurs in three steps, where the third step is a
    combination of the first two steps. This intuition is corroborated
    by what Google Image Search produces:</p>
    <p><img

    <p><strong>Given a thesis (“The sky is blue”), someone comes up with
    an antithesis (“But sometimes the sky is black”) which is merged
    into a synthesis (“At day the sky is blue and at night the sky is
    black”).</strong> Then the process starts again, with the antithesis
    being f.e. “Sometimes there are clouds in the sky”.</p>
    <p>I don’t think that’s an accurate summary of Hegel’s dialectic. If
    it was, why doesn’t anybody just <em>say</em> that? But assuming
    that the above picture <em>is</em> an accurate summary of Hegel’s
    dialectic, we can uncover a neat parallel with undergraduate
    mathematics, particularly <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">PCA</a>.</p>
    <p>I’m assuming that my audience is much more familiar with PCA than
    with continental philosophy, so I will keep the introduction brief:
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method for decomposing a
    dataset into constituents, s.t. some components have
    disproportionately large explanatory power. While the most practical
    way of computing PCA involves <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration">iterated matrix
    juggling</a>, the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis#:~:text=to%20reduce%20dimensionality%29.-,First,-component%5Bedit%5D">conceptual
    explanation</a> of how to get a set of principal components is very
    instructive:</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li>Given your dataset (“the sky”), look for a single vector that
    explains the largest amount of variability (“the sky is blue”) while
    neglecting all the remaining variability (“the sky” - “the sky is
    blue”). This vector (“the sky is blue”) is your first principal
    component.</li>
    <li>After subtracting out the first principal component (“the sky” -
    “the sky is blue”), look again for a single vector that explains the
    largest amount of variability (“the sky is black”) while neglecting
    all the remaining variability (“the sky” - “the sky is blue” - “the
    sky is black”). This vector (“the sky is black”) is your second
    principal component.</li>
    <li>Repeat.</li>
    </ol>

    href="https://labs.openai.com/s/jQWzEvHfIDcwUZVzNejLHmVC">Generated
    with DALL-E.</a></p>
    <p><strong>Framed like this,</strong> <strong>PCA maps naturally
    onto Hegel’s dialectic</strong>! Each principal component
    corresponds to a thesis (and/or) and antithesis, and the combination
    of principal components corresponds to the synthesis. Indeed, in the
    limit, the dialectic process results in truth (all the principal
    components explain all the variability).</p>
    <p>Using this dictionary, we can produce sentences that sound like
    continental philosophy:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>There is no clear division of thesis and antithesis, both are
    aspects of the same dialectic process leading to truth.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Pretty cool, eh? And much easier than all that stuff about the
    “moving soul” and the “in-and-for-itself”. In Hegel’s defense, PCA
    was <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis#:~:text=was%20invented%20in-,1901,-by%20Karl%20Pearson">only
    invented in 1901</a>, some 70 years after Hegel’s death. So he
    <em>couldn’t</em> have explained it in those terms. But if any
    living descendants want to rectify the situation, hmu, I can set up
    a GitHub page with a PCA explainer for y’all.</p>
    <h2 id="i-just-kant-even">I just Kant even</h2>
    <p>This is a bit awkward. While coming up with the idea for this
    post I did not really spend a lot of time fact-checking whether the
    philosophers I’d wanted to talk about are <em>actually</em>
    continental philosophers. And I came up with a cool correspondence
    between Kant’s categorical imperative and Lagrange multipliers. But
    Kant lived before the analytic/continental rift in philosophy
    happened and he has <a
    href="https://science.jrank.org/pages/7595/Continental-Philosophy.html#:~:text=Taking%20different%20stances%20toward%20the,and%20the%20Critique%20of%20Judgment.">influenced
    both camps</a>.</p>
    <p>Hair-splitting over whether Kant fits into the framing of this
    essay or not feels like a suboptimal use of time. <a

    best way out is always through.</a> Let’s not skip a beat and
    pretend that Kant fits. He <em>does</em> talk a lot about
    metaphysics, which is <em>such</em> a continental philosophy thing
    to do.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, Kant’s moral philosophy is usually introduced in
    contrast with utilitarianism à la <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill">Mill</a>.
    Reading the two side-by-side really highlights the disagreement:</p>

    <p>Well, for one, the two never talked to each other (Kant died in
    1804, Mill was born in 1806). Second, it was <a
    href="https://href.li/?http://alturl.com/p749b">proven recently</a>
    that utilitarianism is the “correct” moral philosophy.
    <strong>Third, neither of them ever met<a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/inferring-utility-functions?s=w">John
    von Neumann</a> (born in 1903), so he couldn’t tell them about his

    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">utility
    theorem</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>This theorem is relevant because once you put down mathematical
    notation for what <em>utility</em> means, it becomes obvious very
    quickly that Kant and Mill are in excellent agreement. They just
    have different situations in mind. Let’s write it out:</p>
    <p>Imagine being presented with multiple choices,
    <code>a,b,…,z</code>, and having to choose. Thanks to <a
    href="https://universalprior.substack.com/p/inferring-utility-functions?s=w">von
    Neumann’s utility theorem</a>, you can assign each of these options
    a utility value, <code>u(a),u(b),…,u(z)</code>, and simply pick the
    one with the highest utility, <code>u(m) &gt;= u(n) ∀n</code>.
    That’s just utilitarianism. If you’re feeling fancy, you might also
    take the utility values of your buddy Berta into account,
    <code>v(a),v(b),…,v(z)</code>, and pick the option that produces the
    highest amount of combined utility,
    <code>u(m) + v(m) &gt;= u(n) + v(n) ∀n</code>. Easy peasy lemon
    squeezy. Not sure why Mill needed <a
    href="https://www.readinglength.com/book/isbn-087220605x#:~:text=Word%20Count-,23%2C000,-words">20k
    words</a> to explain this.</p>
    <p>Kant now rightfully points out that this is not a perfect
    strategy in general. In particular, if the optimal option for Berta
    and you happens to be: <code>m = ’eat all the ice cream’</code>,
    then this might make the two of you very happy, but Immanuel and the
    rest of the world would be rather put out. <strong>Or, more to the
    point, it is not sufficient to optimize</strong> _

    <strong><a
    href="https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/26892/what-are-general-equilibrium-effects">constraints
    into account</a>.</strong> Think about what the world would be like
    if <em>everyone</em> picked the same thing as you.</p>
    <p>So, how do we account for global constraints? Well, a constraint
    is just another word for a mathematical function. Let’s say that our
    constraint is that everyone should eat the same amount of ice cream.
    We can write that as a function, <code>f(x) = c</code>, where
    <code>x</code> is our amount of ice cream consumed and
    <code>c</code> is the amount of ice cream consumed by everyone
    else.</p>

    <p>To include a constraint into Von Neumann’s utility theorem, we
    employ another tool from the undergraduate toolkit: <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier">Langrange
    multipliers</a>. Lagrange even was a contemporary of Kant and Mill,
    so there is little excuse for why they didn’t come up with this
    themselves. Instead of natively maximizing utilities,
    <code>u(m) + v(m)</code>, we now optimize for the maximum of
    <code>u(m) + v(m) - λ*(f(x)-c)</code>. Here, <code>λ</code> is the
    Lagrange multiplier, a mathematical way for us to express that we
    should balance the combined utility with the amount of ice cream
    consumed by everyone else. When the constraint is satisfied
    (<code>f(x)=c</code>) the Lagrange multiplier drops out of the
    equation and we can just maximize utility as before.</p>
    <p>Now we see clearly that Kant and Mill are <em>actually</em>
    compatible: <strong>we should pick the option that maximizes both
    utility and that satisfies the constraints</strong>. In the end,
    they’re both just saying:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I like ice cream, but if everyone eats ice cream, the world will
    be a bad place.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="heideggers-being-and-nothingness">Heidegger’s being and
    nothingness</h2>
    <p>Everyone knows that a good essay contains <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)">exactly
    three examples</a>. Now I already did Hegel, Kant, and Mill,
    <em>three</em> examples, but spread across only <em>two</em>
    sections. <strong>To resolve this unfortunate situation I’ll keep
    this section short and only outline in broad strokes how Heidegger’s
    metaphysic can be identified with basic category theory</strong>.
    The scaffolding I provide in this section should be more than
    sufficient for the careful reader to <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5uZQHpecjn7955faL">fill in the
    missing details</a>.</p>
    <p>First, it is important to understand that Heidegger’s “being” is
    neither a thing nor a concept. It is, as Heidegger puts it, the “<a
    href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-heidegger-lexicon/beingness-seiendheit/1DE61C6E46AE0D18FD6AD20A5EB6F061">beingness</a>
    of beings”. Heidegger wants to get at the essence of being, and for
    that, it is important not to think of it as an actual thing. Second,
    Heidegger also wants us to understand that being is not the absence
    of “<a
    href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/">nothingness</a>”.
    Rather, “nothingness” is the absence of being, but the inverse is
    not true.</p>
    <p>So far, so easy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category
    theory</a> can help us to understand the dynamic of Being and
    Nothingness more deeply. A category is a set of things (called
    “objects”) and the relationships between them (called “morphisms”).
    For example, the set of all beings is a category, with beings as
    objects and the relationships between them as morphisms.
    Importantly, in category theory, there is a notion of an “<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_category">opposite
    category</a>”.</p>
    <p>Everything falls naturally into place once we consider opposite
    categories. The opposite category of the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being">category of
    beings</a> is the category of nothingnesses. The objects in this
    category are nothingnesses and the morphisms are the relationships
    between them… well, you get the idea. <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#:~:text=Ontology%2C%20a%20discipline%20of%20philosophy,the%20concept%20of%20Being%20itself.">Heidegger’s
    ontological project</a> is just category theory. He wants us to
    understand that being and nothingness are two different categories
    and that “beingness” (the beingness of beings) is just a morphism
    between those two categories.</p>
