  <p><em>It just annoys me, that’s all. Every century or so, one of
      the squishy ones thinks they are so great and that everybody
      should love them. A millennia ago, I was able to strike a deal
      with the big guy and have him send some plagues on a poor soul
      call Job<sup>[1]</sup>, murder his family, ravage his land and
      body… But recently He has not been very cooperative. No, He would
      not help. Getting rid of the little squishy “saint” would be my
      own yoke to carry. And I know that’s just what He wanted in the
      first place. Puffing sulfur from my nostrils, I acquiesce. The
      squishy thing would suffer for this, oh he would suffer long. But
      I had to be devious about it, there was my reputation at stake.
      And I knew just the trick that I could pull on this one…</em></p>

  <p>The garden started with a tree, the trunk of a tree. The tree
    gave birth to a bush, which in turn gave birth to a large area of
    grass, which in turn gave birth to a beautiful open space, with a
    pool of water in the middle and surrounded by a large area of
    grass. One could walk around the perimeter of the space or sit in
    the middle and enjoy the view. It had always been one of his most
    favorite places. This is where Mahatma met his students and where
    they held their council, discussing the world and its people,
    talking politics, and (to the dismay of more than one of his
    students) studying the secrets of the world revealed by
    mathematics. But today was different from the other days. They had
    an unexpected visitor.</p>
  <p>A thick cloud of smoke descended slowly. Mahatma of course knew
    what it meant, even though this was not part of his religion. But
    being the goody-two-shoes that he was very aware of being, he
    carried no ire towards the “other religions”. In fact, having
    reflected on all of this a long time, he arrived at the conclusion
    that there was little need for conflict. “An eye for an eye only
    ends up making the whole world blind.” yada yada yada. This
    conviction of his would now be tested, being confronted with the
    literal devil in front of his students and all.</p>
  <p>“Mahatma! Cower in fear, mortal. I have come to make you an
    offer!” “… That sounds like an obvious trap. Your reputation
    precedes you, Lucifer.” “Really, this fast? What gave me away? The
    big cloud of sulfur or the thundering voice that makes your bones
    shiver?” “Really, all of those combined.” Mahatma’s casual tone
    was contrasted by his intense gaze that followed the devil’s every
    movement as if he was a snake about to strike. “What’s the deal
    then?” “Ah. It is a deal that comes at a catastrophic cost to you
    personally. But I believe you might still be inclined to take it.”
    “So far, not the best pitch I’ve heard this week… Yesterday
    somebody wanted me to heal their chickens in exchange for their
    spleen. Explaining to them all the ways in which this was a
    terrible idea took the better part of the afternoon.”</p>
  <p>Mahatma’s students giggled at the joke. The devil ignored this
    and looked a bit impatient at Mahatma. “Don’t look at me like
    that! <em>You</em> are the one who arrived here… Okay, tell me
    about your offer.” “It is really very straightforward. I shall
    give you one trillion USD, to use at your own discretion. In
    exchange, I want you to sacrifice 20% of your goodness.”</p>
  <p>Mahatma stared in disbelief while he considered this: <em>Apart
      from the fact that the USD was not really the dominant currency in
      India, the deal sounded overwhelmingly good. One trillion USD…
      With that kind of money, he could do a lot of
      good</em><sup>[2]</sup> <em>. Mahatma had done the research with
      his students. After saturating charities with funding to
      fight</em> <em><a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium">against
        terrible diseases</a> ,</em> <em><a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives">protect
        the most vulnerable</a></em> <em>and</em> <em><a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives">give
        money to the poorest</a> , there would still be enough money left
      to</em> <em><a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/">advocate for those
        that cannot advocate for themselves</a></em> <em>and to put some
      safeguards in place to</em> <em><a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">protect this pale blue dot we
        share</a>. There was a lot of good to be done indeed, he would
      have to run the exact numbers later. The hardest part would be to
      make sure that the money doesn’t “disappear in the cracks” and
      that he would have to make sure that there were no catastrophic
      side effects. Figuring out exactly how to do the most good would
      have to be a</em> <em><a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">community effort</a> ,
      but there was no doubt in his mind that using the money for good
      rather than not using it at all was the right decision.</em></p>

  <p><em>In contrast, what was 20% of his goodness? He was at the
      end of his life anyway, he didn’t think he would get another
      chance to inspire people at as large a scale as he did in his
      youth. There was his legacy to consider, but he also didn’t think
      that losing 20% of his goodness would make him actively evil. He
      tried to add up all the good things he might not be able to bring
      himself to do anymore and all the minor bad things he might end up
      doing. It all felt like a rounding error in comparison
      with…</em></p>
  <p><em>But this was a deal with the devil. This was a trap. He
      could not see how, but it had to be. As much as it pained him, he
      could not accept the offer with this little information and
      reassurance.</em></p>
  <p>“I made a decision…” “Before you decide, you have to know one
    thing.” the devil interrupted. “You have to decide truthfully,
    according to your best moral assessment. If you decide for what
    you do not believe to be right and proper, I will know and I shall
    have your soul for it. Those are the rules of dealing with the
    devil.” “I… never heard about that rule before.” The devil again
    ignored this. Mahatma sighed. And there it was, the trap snapping
    shut.</p>
  <p>“To decide, I need to know: Once I accept the offer, will you
    leave me alone? Is the money cursed? Will any evil come from you
    giving me the money? I need to know, otherwise, I cannot decide
    according to my best moral assessment.” The devil grinned… “No.”
    he drawled. “Nothing bad will come from me giving you the money.
    The money is not cursed. And as soon as we have no more business,
    I will leave you alone. This, I speak truthfully.”</p>
  <p>“Then, my hands are tied. I have to answer truthfully, even if
    it is the answer you clearly desire to hear. But if you’ll have my
    soul in any case, I shall wait a bit longer to see what will be my
    downfall. I accept the deal.”</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_154.png" /></p>
  <p>The devil waved his pitchfork and a dark cloud surrounded
    Mahatma. Mahatma felt some of his goodness drain out of him. Some
    of his happy childhood memories became a bit less bright. Some of
    the inspiring books he read rang a bit less clear in his mind.
    Some of his resolve to protect what he loved cracked. He became a
    bit pettier.</p>
  <p>The devil took 20% of his goodness.</p>
  <p>“Alright, that sucked,” Mahatma said and was a bit surprised at
    the expletive. He did not usually use those in front of his
    students. Or, really, at all. “I suppose you will not just give me
    the trillion and leave?” The devil waved his pitchfork again and a
    large check for 1 trillion dollars with Mahatma’s name as the
    recipient materialized. “The money is yours. But first…” “Of
    course” “But first, let me make you another offer.”</p>
  <p>Mahatma was already dreading the end of this. “Shoot.” “You
    will give me another 20% of your goodness. In exchange, I will add
    an additional 100 million USD and also turn five randomly chosen
    people into mass murderers.”</p>
  <p>Mahatma’s mind was racing and doing another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">Fermi
      estimate</a>: <em>Five mass murders with ~ ten victims on average
      means 50 people dead. In contrast, 100 million USD can save the
      lives of… urgh, crap.</em> He cursed his mind for working fast.
    But he had already felt it when hearing the deal. He thought it
    was a good deal. He was not sure he would have thought so before
    giving up 20% of his goodness, but now the sacrifice felt just
    about commensurable with 100 million USD.</p>
  <p>And in that moment he realized what would happen next. He would
    have to accept and then there would be another deal and that would
    be even worse. And eventually, all of his goodness would be gone
    and he would not be using the money to do anything worthwhile at
    all. He might even end up donating it to “sweaters for kittens” or
    something. What would his students think?</p>
  <p>The problem was - he actually, deep down, believed that the new
    deal was good. He could not, in all honesty, say that the deal did
    not pass his moral bar. He <em>wanted</em> to take the deal. All
    the color drained from Mahatma’s face. The devil’s grin became
    even larger. “I am waiting for your answer, Mahatma. Surely you
    have already made up your mind, the deal should not be hard to
    decide on.”</p>
  <p>There had to be a way out… Suddenly, insight came to him.</p>
  <p><em>(Take a bit of time to think about what you would do in
      Mahatma’s situation!)</em></p>
  <hr />
  <p>“Ah, it’s obvious.” “What?” the devil said, the hellish grin
    slowly sliding from his face. Mahatma waved to one of his students
    sitting on the bench. “Syneídisi, can you do me a favor? Can you
    remind me not to accept the next deal the devil is offering me if
    it is worse than the current one? I’m precommiting now and I’m
    asking you to be my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_partner">accountability
      buddy</a>.” Syneídisi understood immediately and nodded
    emphatically.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_155.png" /></p>
  <p>“You… can’t… just… what?” “I accept your deal, Lucifer. Those
    that suffer from my decision will haunt me, but it is the best
    solution I can find.”</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_156.png" /></p>
  <p>The devil waved his pitchfork again, this time with less
    conviction. Another check materialized as the black mist returned
    to draw the additional 20% goodness from Mahatma. His view on the
    world became a bit darker, his love for his students wained, he
    became somewhat bitter, sarcastic, and detached. <em>What have I
      gotten myself into?</em> Mahatma thought. <em>I should not have
      gotten involved. Why do I always have to get involved?</em></p>
  <p>A second black mist materialized that was even darker than the
    one that surrounded Mahatma and its eerie aura radiated “Bad!
    Stop!”. The mist shot off, splitting into five separate clouds
    that soon disappeared in the distance.</p>
  <p>The devil regained some of his composure. This was the part he
    enjoyed the most. “See what you have wrought, you <em>saint</em>.
    Five innocent souls will wake up tomorrow with new… urges. They
    will struggle and squirm, but they will succumb. It might take a
    while, but eventually, they will succumb, they always do. And you
    are to blame.” The inner turmoil was visible in Mahatma’s face but
    he did not object. There would be time to fix this later. First,
    he had to get rid of the visitor.</p>
  <p>“But listen, Mahatma, I have another deal to offer you.” “No
    chance.” Flames shot up out of nowhere and the devil’s eyes were
    glowing. “ <em>Listen</em> to me first, mortal. I will give you an
    additional ten million dollars as well as a private yacht. In
    exchange, ten additional random mass murderers.” Only a small
    twitch in Mahatma’s face revealed that he was considering the
    offer and that he was disgusted by his own conclusion. <em>I would
      never actually meet the strangers whose lives I would destroy. And
      ten million dollars could still do a lot of good, not just for the
      world, but also for the community that I built with so much care.
      And the yacht… I know that I am supposed to be above such
      temptations, but after a life of toiling away for other people, I
      surely must have earned…</em> He shoved the thought away and
    returned to the situation before him. He turned to his
    students.</p>
  <p>“Syneídisi, what do you think? Should I accept the deal?”
    Syneídisi simply shook their head. “Then I don’t…” The devil
    interrupted: “You have to decide according to your <em>own</em>
    best moral assessment! And I know that you want to take the deal!
    You can’t just shove the responsibility onto your student!” “Don’t
    play the fool, Lucifer.” Now it was Mahatma’s voice that took on a
    threatening tone and whose eyes were piercing. “The game is over,
    I’ve seen through your trick. You don’t <em>get</em> at all what
    it means to be good. Yes, calculating is important, but even more
    important is to leave <a href="https://www.williammacaskill.com/info-moral-uncertainty">room
      for doubt</a> in your own judgment! Otherwise, you can convince
    yourself of everything and nothing! You need friends and a
    community to grow and to make the hard decisions that you can’t
    make alone. I trust in the counsel of my students. This is a moral
    belief that sits even deeper than any desire for a yacht or other
    short-term temptations. And if my student reminds me of upholding
    my precommitment, then following their reminder is the moral thing
    to do. If you had taken more of my goodness I might not have
    remembered that truth - but I did. And I do. I reject your
    offer.”</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_157.png" /></p>
  <p>Flames shot again from the ground as the devil burst into a fit
    of rage, but, screaming murder at the top of his lung, the ground
    had already begun to open and to pull him downward. Soon there was
    nothing left except for a stinging smell of sulfur in the air.</p>
  <p>Mahatma’s students jumped from their seats and began rushing
    towards their teacher to congratulate him on escaping the devil’s
    trick. But Mahatma stopped them, looking grim. “Thank you,
    everyone. Thank you, Syneídisi. We averted a much darker fate, but
    today is not a day to celebrate. There are things we have to do. I
    hope you have learned my lessons well because now you will have to
    teach me. I’m afraid I have forgotten a lot through this terrible
    deal…” His voice trailed off. He wanted to ask his students to
    make some calls to some of his friends and to start planning how
    to spend the trillion USD the deal had left him with. But he did
    not trust his own judgment right now. He would have to relearn a
    lot first.</p>
  <p>But there was one wrong thing that he could see clearly and
    there was little doubt that it required fixing. He had only
    accepted that five innocent people would slowly turn into mass
    murderers in exchange for the opportunity to do more good. He did
    not <em>want</em> them to have this fate.</p>
  <p>“I have committed a great evil today by putting five innocent
    people on track to commit atrocities. But it is not yet too late
    to undo what I have done. The devil said that the desire to kill
    will only slowly grow in them. If I can get to them before that, I
    might be able to avert their fate. I want to leave and find them,
    while I relearn some of my goodness. In the meantime…” It pained
    him to say the next sentence, but he trusted his students more
    than he hated the thought of giving away the money. “I leave the
    money to you. Follow my teachings in spending it. When I have
    completed my task, I will return and help you do more good.”</p>
  <p>With those words, Mahatma turned away from his gaping students.
    He had barely made three steps away as Syneídisi caught up to him
    and started walking beside him. Mahatma smiled.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

    <p>The Book of Job (/dʒoʊb/; Hebrew: אִיּוֹב‎ – ʾIyyōḇ) addresses the
      problem of theodicy, meaning why God permits evil in the world,
      through the experiences of the eponymous protagonist.[^1] Job is a
      wealthy and God-fearing man with a comfortable life and a large
      family; God, having asked Satan (Hebrew: הַשָּׂטָן‎ – haśśāṭān,
      literally “the accuser”) for his opinion of Job’s piety, decides
      to take away Job’s wealth, family and material comforts, following
