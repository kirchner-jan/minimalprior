    <p>It was a delight talking to Anna! Check out her <a
    href="https://www.riedlanna.com/">webpage</a> and keep your eyes
    open for future videos. Here’s an excerpt from our conversation on
    different scientific mindsets:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Anna: <em>Another thought that came to me right now - because you
    mentioned ‘doubt’ being a very central thing in academia. That’s
    something I often think about when I think of mental health problems
    in academia. Questioning yourself and questioning your ideas seems
    to be so central to the scientific method - but you always wonder
    ‘How is it wrong?’. And you always have to anticipate ‘What would
    another smart person criticize about what you’re doing?’. You
    basically internalize this way of thinking. It seems pretty
    straightforward that you have a very harsh internal monologue after
    doing this every day.</em></p>
    <p>Jan: <em>Yeah, that is a super interesting observation. I guess
    every individual step that you’re describing is this ‘Karl Popper’,
    classic falsificationism, where you try to disprove every hypothesis
    that you come up with. This is taken to an extreme in the
    interaction with reviewers, which can be super uncomfortable
    (speaking from experience). And there you get this cognitive
    dissonance where you try to model what the ‘adversary’ is going to
    say to whatever statement you’re making.</em></p>
    <p><em>But research practice… I mean there are other theories of how
    science is working. One prominent opponent of Popper is Thomas Kuhn
    who’s saying that there are ’scientific paradigms’. Instead of ‘at
    every individual step question all of your assumptions and trying to
    break them’ you rather have a set of core theses and then around
    that a set of auxiliary theses. You try to push those core theses
    forward and just see how far you can get by assuming them. And
    whenever you encounter evidence that goes against your construct of
    theses, you start modifying your auxiliary theses instead of
    modifying your core theses. I think that’s a lot more congruent with
    how the human mind wants to work in many cases.</em></p>
    <p><em>So of course this Kuhnian framework can only work if there
    are multiple paradigms in parallel interacting with each other -
    otherwise there’s no correction mechanism anymore that tells us at
    what point we’re running in a wrong direction. Also, this way of
    thinking has been criticized as ‘p-hacking’. ‘P-hacking’ is this
    practice of tweaking your parameters until you ‘finally’ get your
    significant result and you can start publishing. Which is terrible
    for science at large and a big contributing factor to the
    reproduction crisis in psychology…</em></p>
