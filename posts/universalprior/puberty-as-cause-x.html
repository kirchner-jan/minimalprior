    <p>Within the effective altruism community, there is a game (in the
    broadest sense of the word) that goes like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Imagine it’s 50 years in the future. Which part of our early
    21st-century civilization will make people 50 years from now recoil
    in horror?</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It’s a pretty weird game, as “winning” means that you will start
    seeing atrocities committed everywhere, which can’t be
    healthy<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

    21st century.</p>
    </div>
    <p>But, I argue, the “game” component stems from a dynamic where
    people come up with the most <em>surprising</em> proposal for
    unnoticed widespread atrocity (also called “<a

    <p>In this spirit, here is my contribution. Could it be that 50
    years from now, we will look back and say:</p>

    <p>“Oh boy, people really used to be blind. How on earth did we miss

    never seen anything so unsteady, so uncertain, as this

    ― <strong>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here is the short version: 1 in 25 describes high school time as
    the <a
    href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/16807/high-school-worst-times-best-times.aspx">worst
    time in their life</a>. <a
    href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005310.pdf">Fourteen percent of

    href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27641333">Life satisfaction

    href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-23009-002">increases only

    this bad stuff is linked to forcing kids to go to high school, <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927082731/https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/Bullying_Factsheet.pdf">where

    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[5] </p>
    <p>This probably looks different now, with even more bullying
    happening online. But I’d guess it’s still mostly in the context of
    school.</p>
    </div>
    <p>And now the extended version:</p>
    <p>Let us take the possibility seriously that we find out in 50
    years that high school is some kind of moral atrocity. Is there a
    way we can work towards a solution already today?</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80000 hours</a> project has
    a framework for tackling this type of question: the <a
    href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/itn-framework-1">ITN
    framework</a>. When thinking about which vital problem to work on,
    we might evaluate</p>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li><strong>I</strong> mpact. If we solved the problem, how good
    would it be?</li>
    <li><strong>T</strong> ractability. If we doubled the resources
    dedicated to solving this problem, what fraction of the problem
    would we expect to solve?</li>
    <li><strong>N</strong> eglectedness. How many resources are already
    going towards solving this problem?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is a more <a
    href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/most-pressing-problems/">informal</a>
    and a more <a
    href="https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/">formal</a>
    version of this framework, and my analysis falls somewhere in the
    middle.</p>
    <h3 id="impact."><strong>Impact.</strong></h3>
    <p><a
    href="https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/#:~:text=ill%2Dhealth%20worldwide%20%28-,measured,-in%20QALYs%20lost">Traditionally</a>,
    the impact was often measured in QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life
    Years). But <a
    href="https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/health-metrics.html">QUALYs
    are bad</a> because they ask people to <em>imagine</em> how bad
    certain conditions are. A <a
    href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nevDBjuCPMCuaoMYT/we-care-about-walys-not-qalys">better</a><a
    href="https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/walys.html">alternative
    is WELLBYs</a> (Well-being Adjusted Life Years), which derive from
    asking how people in the condition feel.</p>
    <p>One way to measure WELLBYs is via “life satisfaction point years”
    (LSP), where 1 LSP is equivalent to increasing life satisfaction for
    one person by one point on a 10 point scale for a year. To
    illustrate, here is an excerpt from a table from <a
    href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177892/the-origins-of-happiness">Clark
    et al. (2018)</a>:</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_65.png" />Life
    satisfaction is typically computed on a Likert scale from 0 to 10,
    which also comes with <a
    href="https://colourware.org/2014/02/18/the-dangers-of-likert-scale-data/">a
    bunch of caveats</a></p>
    <p>Conveniently, there is a ton of life satisfaction data for high
    school time. Here is<a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17440827/">Goldbeck et
    al. (2007)</a>:</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_66.png" /></p>
    <p>I like them because they have a great sample size (n=1,274 German
    adolescents), they are from Germany, and they were among the first
    to rigorously show this effect. I don’t like them because they use a
    <a
    href="https://www.sogosurvey.com/blog/when-why-and-how-to-use-weighted-scores-in-survey-rating-questions/">weighted
    satisfaction score</a>, and I have difficulty figuring out how they
    computed it. I think it should be between 0 and 100 and then the
    decrease would be -0.5 per year. But I’m not sure that’s actually
    it; in other Figures from that paper, the points go above 100.</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/29/5/960/5422987?login=true">Herke
    et al. (2019)</a> is 12 years later but has a <em>fantastic</em>
    sample size (n=12 564 German adolescents) and explicitly says that
    they scale the score between 0 and 100:</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_67.png" /></p>
    <p><a

    et al. (2017)</a> have a slightly smaller sample (n=940 Spanish
    adolescents), but their statistic is easier to interpret:</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_68.png" /></p>
    <p>This looks equally damning, again with a -0.5 change in life
    satisfaction per year. <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-021-09846-9">Aymerich
    et al. (2021)</a> also find this effect (n=600 Spanish
    adolescents)<sup>[6]</sup>. <a
    href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-24000-001">Willroth et
    al. (2021)</a> find no changes from age 14 to age 17 (n=674
    Mexica-origin adolescents). This is consistent with the previous
    studies, where most of the drop occurs before age 14. <a
    href="https://www.scirp.org/html/7-6901064_45333.htm">Uusitalo-Malmivaara
    (2014)</a> also finds a drop in life satisfaction between ages 12
    and 15 (n=339 Finnish adolescents). Still, the effect size looks a
    lot less impressive (AFAICT only a total change of -0.4 in three
    years). <a
    href="https://www.pprc.gg/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JHS.LS-Review.pdf">Proctor
    et al. (2008)</a> do a meta-study and find that:</p>
    <div class="sidenote">

    Tatar 2001), South Korea (e.g. Park 2005), and China (e.g. Chang et

    </blockquote>
    <p>Okay, I’m convinced something is going on here. But could it be
    that children below the age of 10 are just unreasonably <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HawFh7RvDM4RyoJ2d/three-worlds-collide-0-8">super-happy</a>,
    and the drop in life satisfaction comes from having to confront the
    harsh reality of the world?</p>
    <p><em>Could</em> be, but these roughly 600 Finnish adolescents
    about to graduate from school and surveyed by <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10902-009-9156-3#Fig1">Salmela-Aro
    et al. (2010)</a> beg to differ:</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_69.png" /></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/19/3690">Steinmayr et
    al. (2019)</a> find the same thing for 476 German adolescents, but
    their layout for data presentation is basically criminal. <a
    href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behaviour-change/article/abs/quality-of-life-in-adolescence-the-role-of-perceived-control-parenting-style-and-social-support/FDAE9F75B883507114E8782B6FAE0C31">Petito
    et al. (2012)</a> claim that 279 adolescents have lower life
    satisfaction than adults, but I can’t access their study. When I
    line all these studies up like this, the story appears relatively
    straightforward: Life satisfaction drops by one or two points
    between the age of 11 and 16. Then there is a rebound from 16 to
    19.</p>
    <p>However, here’s an important <strong>note of caution</strong> :
    I’m just a guy <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-not-reading-papers">(not)
    reading papers</a> on the internet. I’m not at all confident about
    my reading of the literature (not my area of expertise <em>at
    all</em> ), and <a
    href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128046746000132">Luhmann
    (2017)</a> says that:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>any conclusions about the average trajectories of [subjective
    well-being] in children and adolescents are premature given the lack
    of studies that follow large-scale samples of children and
    adolescents over multiple years.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I’m not convinced by the argument they bring forward for this
    conclusion<sup>[7]</sup>, but they have a Ph.D. in this topic, and I
    don’t. So if anybody has a more careful reading of the literature,
    I’d be happy to hear about it!</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[7] </p>
    <p>The whole passage from<a
    href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128046746000132">Luhmann
    (2017)</a> is:</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="shut-up-and-calculate."><strong>Shut up and
    calculate.</strong></h4>
    <p>Despite the considerable uncertainty around these numbers, I’d
    conservatively estimate that, <em>on average,</em> adolescents
    experience a decrease of -0.2-0.4 LSP relative to baseline between
    the ages of 11 and 16. How bad is that?</p>
    <p><a
    href="https://sci-hub.se/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272989X11435173">Dolan
    and Metcalfe (2012)</a> show us the impact of different impairments
    on life satisfaction.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_70.png" /></p>
    <p>Here life satisfaction is scaled to the range between 0 and 1, so
    we have to multiply them by 10 to compare these values with the
    decrease in LSP during adolescence. This would put adolescence in
    the ballpark of “some problem washing or dressing”, “moderate pain
    or discomfort”, and “unable to perform usual activities”.
    Consistently, Clark et al. (2018) from the beginning of this
    section, adolescence falls somewhere between one physical illness
    per year (-0.22) and being widowed (-0.48). This describes my
    experience during adolescence almost perfectly, actually.</p>
    <p>This is pretty damning, especially considering that we are
    talking about the <strong>average among adolescents.</strong> At the
    same time, the effect on wellbeing in all the other studies is
    computed only for the subset of people that stand out for showing
    symptoms of distress. So every person that had an average or even
    excellent time during adolescence implies another person that had it
    proportionally worse.</p>
    <p>Joel McGuire from the Happier Lives Institute has a great post on
    the impact of cash transfers on subjective wellbeing. He performs a
    careful meta-analysis and <a
    href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PPNgQSvKrcKvsM2ZN/the-effect-of-cash-transfers-on-subjective-well-being-and#:~:text=deviations%2C%20or%20roughly-,0.87%20WELLBYs,-.%5B10%5D%5B11%5D">finds</a>
    that a transfer of $1000 to someone living in “global poverty”
    results in an increase of roughly 0.87 WELLBYs. It’s probably unfair
    to rip this number from his report without any of the additional
    qualifications and caveats he provides. Still, this post is already
    too long as it is.</p>
    <p>In summary: I’m already way outside of my intellectual comfort
    zone, but to put the money where my mouth is and to start a
    discussion: <strong>fixing whatever makes<a
    href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/adolescent-health#:~:text=than%20ever%20before%3A-,1.2%20billion,-%2C%20totalling%20one%20sixth">1.2

    average) could have the same positive impact as giving 1.2 billion
    people living in global poverty $1000 each, or relieving 1.2 billion

    <p>This is where the analysis gets a bit hairier<sup>[9]</sup>. All
    the data I presented in the previous section is purely correlational
    and establishes <em>zero</em> causation. <a
    href="https://www.pprc.gg/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JHS.LS-Review.pdf">Proctor
    et al. (2009)</a>, after doing a thorough meta-analysis of 141

    <p>Additional research is required in order to further discover

    </blockquote>
    <p>If we don’t know which factors contribute to the decrease in life
    satisfaction, we will have difficulty evaluating tractability.</p>
    <p>So, instead, let’s tackle the problem one level higher. How can
    we identify candidate interventions for improving life satisfaction
    in adolescents? I came up with three categories by imagining that we
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_induction">have
    solved the problem in 50 years and working back from there</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="when-all-you-have-is-a-hammer"><strong>When all you have is

    <p><strong>Angle of attack?</strong> While <a
    href="https://www.pprc.gg/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JHS.LS-Review.pdf">Proctor
    et al. (2009)</a> are hesitant about naming causal factors, they
    <em>do</em> highlight several factors that “foster” positive life
    satisfaction (LS).</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Among these [factors] are the fundamentally positive outcomes on
    LS that emerge as a result of a healthy lifestyle, good physical
    health, exercise, and participation in sports and social activities.
    Conversely, non-participation in risk-taking behaviour, including:
    substance abuse (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs),
    violence, aggression, and sexual victimization, is associated with
    elevated levels of LS. Similarly, environmental quality, such as,
    living in a safe neighbourhood, residing in a well maintained home,
    infrequent relocation, good familial and parental relationships, and
    social support, all engender positive youth LS.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It appears at least plausible that if we manage to provide all
    these things to teenagers everywhere, teenage suffering might be
    reduced.</p>
    <p><strong>What can we do about it?</strong> Ensuring that
    adolescents collectively experience these positive factors appears
    rather daunting. But if certain <a

    then life in the future might indeed ensure a <a
    href="https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/2050">near-perfect

    href="https://www.pprc.gg/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/JHS.LS-Review.pdf">Proctor

    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/bue4qo/am_i_the_only_person_who_feels_that_school_was/">anecdotal

    <p>And they appear to be doing <em>something</em>! According to data
    by<a
    href="https://www.journaljesbs.com/index.php/JESBS/article/view/30160">Due
    et al. (2019)</a>, there was a large drop in the percentage of
    Danish adolescents exposed to bullying in the late 90s (the authors
    don’t know why this is, but believe it’s due to raised
    awareness<sup>[11]</sup>), and a more moderate decline
    afterward.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[11] </p>
    <p>Here’s the relevant passage:</p>
    </div>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_71.png" /></p>
    <p>The slow decline since the early 2000s is also mirrored in <a
    href="https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/bullying-down-from-a-decade-ago-but-unchanged-since-2013">data
    from the U.S.</a>, although the baseline is higher, around 30%. I
    like to believe that this is because the Danish are just friendlier
    by nature, but, realistically, it’s probably due to differences in
    definition<sup>[12]</sup>. A slow but steady decline might make us
    hopeful that the problem will dissolve itself in 50 years.
    Unfortunately, <a
    href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/509349/student-cyber-bullying-offending-rate-usa/">statistics
    on cyberbullying</a> look a bit less promising<sup>[13]</sup>.</p>

    <p>[12] </p>
    <p>I think this data would suggest at least two tests for the
    hypothesis that “bullying drives lowered life satisfaction”.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Assuming that bullying will level off at a nonzero, constant
    rate, we might need additional interventions beyond awareness
    campaigns to protect the victims of bullying. <a
    href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6012206">Anonymous
    surveillance</a>, if implemented reliably, might provide the tools
    to identify destructive social dynamics before they escalate into
    bullying dynamics. However, maintaining anonymity when resolving
    these dynamics is challenging.</p>

    <p>While the previous interventions attempt to tackle the problem at
    the societal level, not all of the factors leading to suffering
    during puberty are due to external factors. In particular, I’ve
    already alluded to the fact that the brain of adolescents has to go
    through a lot during puberty. <a
    href="https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/behavior/human-development/v/brain-changes-during-adolescence">Conventional</a><a
    href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_jayne_blakemore_the_mysterious_workings_of_the_adolescent_brain/transcript?language=en#t-262099">wisdom</a>
    backed up by <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1099_861">evidence</a> is
    that the grey matter of the frontal cortex (containing cell bodies
    of neurons) grows more prominent and then shrinks again during
    puberty.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_72.png" /><a

    <p>This might explain why teenagers are <em>weird</em> and make bad
    decisions, but not necessarily why they might be
    <em>unhappy</em>.</p>
    <p>The other conventional wisdom is that the amygdala, a region of
    the brain primarily associated with emotional processes, is also
    strongly affected by puberty. This is <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2178">the case in rats</a>,
    <a
    href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2826.2010.02075.x">hamsters</a>,
    and, thanks to <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10765-1#Fig4">Sorrells
    et al. (2019)</a>, we know that this is the case in humans.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_73.png" /></p>
    <p>Changes in the amygdala could <em>totally</em> explain why
    teenagers are unhappy. We also <a
    href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067167/">suspect</a>
    differences between the left and the right amygdala. We <a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919310328?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint">suspect</a>
    there might be differences between males and females. Beyond this,
    it is still exceedingly unclear how the amygdala (and the limbic
    system in general) and we don’t know a lot more beyond this.</p>
    <p><strong>What can we do about it?</strong> There might be
    pharmacological (or non-obvious lifestyle) interventions to soften
    the emotional blow of puberty without affecting any of the necessary
    developmental processes. <a
    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471741/">Some
    researchers</a> call for “aging” to be classified as a disease.
    Perhaps an analogous argument can be made for puberty. Further
    research on this question (particularly on the amygdala’s role in
    puberty) could help clarify the situation and potentially even lead
    to interventions to alleviate suffering during
    adolescence<sup>[14]</sup>.</p>

    <p>I’ve been bugging people for a long while with the idea that we
    might look back at puberty and shudder in horror. I tend to receive
    the same responses, so I have a FAQ:</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is puberty really that bad? My experience
    wasn’t that bad.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>A:</strong> My experience also wasn’t that bad; I was
    mostly bored. But I know <a
    href="https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2018/04/15/the-case-against-education/">some
    people</a> for who it was terrible. And the statistics also don’t
    look great.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Really really? I don’t even remember
    <em>seeing</em> anything too terrible. Are people just blowing this
    out of proportion?</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>A:</strong> A lot of this stuff is <a
    href="https://www.unicef.org/media/66916/file/Hidden-in-plain-sight.pdf">hidden
    in plain sight</a>, and if you don’t know what to look for, you
    might not notice it. This might just be one of those situations
    where different sets of people have <a
    href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/">entirely
    different experiences about the world</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Q:</strong> But adolescence also has good aspects!
    It’s exciting that so many things are changing, and you rediscover
    yourself and your relationship with the world…</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>A:</strong> No, no, I’m with you. If we optimize away
    what makes us human, it’s no optimization after all.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>But vegetarians can still have delicious food! Same-sex marriage
    does not subtract from more “traditional” models. Reducing plastic
    waste does not have to mean giving up on the comforts of modern
    life. Perhaps we can have adolescence without some of the bad
    stuff.</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p><strong>Q:</strong> I think you are thinking about this from
    the wrong perspective. Adolescence is <em>supposed</em> to suck.
    Adolescence is… like bootcamp. You know. It’s tough, but it makes
    you strong. There are some hard lessons you just have to learn. It
    sucks that some people have a bad time, but perhaps that’s just how
    it has to be?</p></li>

    I’m having this conversation with is no longer arguing in good
    faith.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Q:</strong> Okay, okay, I admit, perhaps there are
    some things that could be better. But this problem appears suuuuper
    intractable. Adolescence is such a fundamental thing…</p></li>

    <p><em>Only a few studies have examined age differences in SWB in
    adolescence systematically. A consistent cross-sectional finding is
    that life satisfaction is lower (Goldbeck, Schmitz, Besier,
    Herschbach, &amp; Henrich, 2007; Moksnes, Løhre, &amp; Espnes, 2013;
    Weber, Ruch, &amp; Huebner, 2013) and depressive mood is higher
    (Costello, Swendsen, Rose, &amp; Dierker, 2008) in mid-adolescence
    than in early adolescence. However, in a longitudinal study of
    American 6th to 12th graders followed over 2 years, average levels
    of life satisfaction did not change significantly over this period
    (Lyons, Huebner, Hills, &amp; Van Horn, 2013). Furthermore, a
    longitudinal study of Finnish highschool students found increasing
    average life satisfaction levels from 9th grade until 2 years later
    (Salmela-Aro &amp; Tuominen-Soini, 2010). In sum, any conclusions
    about the average trajectories of SWB in children and adolescents
    are premature given the lack of studies that follow large-scale
    samples of children and adolescents over multiple years. The
    remainder of this chapter therefore focuses on the development of
    SWB from early adulthood to old age, on which more and better
    studies are available.</em></p>
    <p>Due to the speed of light and the resulting impossibility of time
    travel, they don’t take <a
    href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/29/5/960/5422987?login=true">Herke
    et al. (2019)</a> into account, which has a great sample size and
    clearly shows the effect. But even without that strong data point,
    I’m confused why they regard <a

    et al. (2010)</a> as evidence against the trend - the age range
    studied there is much later than in all the other studies. So it’s
    no evidence against a decline; it’s evidence for a decline followed
    by a rebound.</p>
