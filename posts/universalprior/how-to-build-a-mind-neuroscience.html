    <p>There is a story about John Nash that I like a lot. John Nash is
    a famous mathematician who got a (fake) Nobel prize for his work in
    game theory as well as a Hollywood adaptation starring Russell
    Crowe. But (if you trust his biography) his contribution to
    mathematics is at least as great. He had a very curious way of
    working:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Nash’s main mode of picking up information he deemed
    necessary consisted of quizzing various faculty members and fellow
    students. […] Some of his best ideas came “from things learned only
    halfway, sometimes even wrongly, and trying to reconstruct them -
    even if he could not do so completely.</em> (A Beautiful Mind,
    Sylvia Nasar, pg 68)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He started out with something very wrong, then went with his
    first (wrong) attempt at a solution to one of his colleagues, who
    helped make it slightly less wrong. Nash then repeated this
    procedure until, in the end, he had a working proof.</p>
    <p>Apart from some hard questions about ownership (can Nash really
    claim that he produced the proof?) and the obvious issue that Nash
    turned very schizophrenic in his later years, I admire this way of
    working (at least for doing very hard research) and aspire to do the
    same. I really really want to get answers - and I don’t care if I
    have to recruit help and produce a lot of nonsense on the way. This
    is, of course, just a poor fig leave of a defense for all the
    nonsense I am producing on this platform. Mea culpa.1</p>
    <h2 id="several-perspectives-on-development">Several perspectives on
    development</h2>
    <p>After building a digital person, writing love letters to
    albatrosses, philosophizing about scale in academia, and asking
    large language models pointed questions, it is time to write about
    something where I actually have institutional credentials,
    i.e. neuroscience and the development of the brain. Why is this an
    interesting topic?2 While traditionally brain development is a very
    biology-heavy topic, there are some beautiful results and ideas that
    generalize far beyond biology and become relevant for people working
    on artificial intelligence or computations in general. And those
    results are not widely known, especially not outside a small
    community in (computational) neuroscience. This essay is written
    with this in mind and I have tried to reduce jargon to a
    minimum.</p>
    <p>The biology info in this post is focused on small mammals (mouse
    pups), which might feel like a limitation3. But then again, mice can
    do a lot more than you’d think. Exhibit 1 - skateboard mouse!</p>

    it helps to have all four limbs so close to the floor. source</p>

    <p>I would not call myself a biologist by any stretch of the
    imagination - but I can get very excited about videos.
    <em>Seeing</em> biology in action is very cool.</p>
    <p><strong>Embryonic Day 1</strong>: Here is a recording of a mouse
    embryo at the “two-cell stage”.</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b3d19b9-9557-4797-b68d-d23ec504aad2_213x213.gif" /></p>
    <p>The cell surface marker in green was only imaged for the final
    division from 32 to ~64 cells. It doesn’t just pop into existence.
    Strnad et al Nature Methods 2016</p>
    <p><strong>Embryonic Day 6-8</strong>: From there, things get out of
    hand quickly. Cells just <em>keep</em> on dividing.</p>
    <p>It’s not super easy to see, but inside that ball of cells is a
    sheet of cells that folds into a tube (appropriately named the
    neural tube) that will eventually develop into the central nervous
    system (i.e. brain and spinal cord).</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c53960-a7c9-436b-a180-35bf02de2df0_320x219.gif" /></p>
    <p>This clip is supposed to show the folding of the neural tube, but
    it’s still kind of hard to see.</p>
    <p><strong>Embryonic Day 11</strong>: And then we’re basically
    there. Just add a few tiny paws, mouth, eyes, tail, all the good
    stuff.</p>
    <p><strong>Embryonic day 20/Postnatal day 1</strong>: The mouse pup
    is born! But at that point, the pup is still “extremely-not-ready”
    for the world. “Day 1” here is the first day after birth.</p>
    <p><img

    <p>Check out the full video on YouTube, it’s worth it!</p>
    <p><strong>Postnatal day 10</strong>: While there is a lot happening
    “on the inside”, not so much is showing on the outside. We still
    only have a pile of adorable mouse pups.</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F370a412d-600c-47c4-bf24-f79a184d30a8_1280x720.gif" /></p>
    <p>(The big hairy ones are actually female adult mothers, called
    “dams”).</p>
    <p><strong>Postnatal day 25</strong>: But fast-forward 15 more days
    and it’s like day and night - the mice (not pups anymore) are
    basically ready to go! Around postnatal day 14, they open their
    eyes, grow hair, and start running around.</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48152843-673c-4bb1-a730-4c9edfac1695_1280x720.gif" /></p>
    <p>There is still a lot more that happens after this stage (the
    brain keeps changing throughout the entire lifetime), but these
    first 2-3 weeks set up a <em>lot</em> of the central nervous
    system.</p>
    <p>It is great how <em>visual</em> this part of biology is. I hope
    you found those videos as enjoyable as I did. It’s very important to
    get a <em>feel</em> for what you are talking about, otherwise, you
    might miss what’s in plain sight. In the end, all models and
    theories cash out to a handful of cells or a pile of mouse pups.
    Everything is very <em>messy</em>.</p>
    <h2 id="a-molecular-biology-perspective">A molecular biology
    perspective</h2>
    <p>Okay, that’s what development looks like. How does it work? Let’s
    zoom in a bit further. Those first cells in the clip at the top
    contain the entire genetic code. Can we understand that? How does it
    instruct the cells to divide like that and to form that ball and the
    pile of pups and do all the other things? Those are reasonable
    questions, right?</p>
    <p>Well, take <strong>this</strong> as an answer:</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74810b5a-ad9d-40d6-ad5b-104a6a30ef21_850x529.png" /></p>
    <p>The caption of this image contains the encouraging phrase
    “Interactions among these pathways are multiple and complex.” This
    is also just the first example taken from Google, there are many
    many more diagrams like this and they all draw a lot of arrows in a
    lot of different directions. source</p>
    <p>That’s a lot to take in and if you make the mistake of asking an
    expert about it, you will learn 1000 interesting facts about “Bmi
    inhibition of p19” before lunchtime. Luckily I am not an expert on
    molecular biology, so I will give you just the most high-level
    explanation of how development happens on the molecular level:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The behavior of a cell is determined by the proteins it
    expresses. The “central dogma” of molecular biology says that “DNA
    makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”, so proteins come from the genes.
    Since we want a lot of different cells that do different things, we
    need cells with different proteins. “Signaling pathways” (like Sonic
    Hedgehog, Wnt, ErbB, IGF-IR, and Notch) can tell the cell which
    genes to express and, therefore, which protein to express. How does
    the brain know which signals to send to which cell? It just makes
    sure that different signalling molecules end up in different parts
    of the developing brain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>All of this is, like, <em>really</em> complicated, but we4 are
    making good headway in improving our understanding. And perhaps
    there is hope that things will get easier to understand when we know
    more. Perhaps everything will just beautifully fall into place. But
    also perhaps not:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>There is no rule that says nature can not be more complex than
    our brains can handle. And after billions of years of evolution, why
    should it be simple?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Perhaps there are no shortcuts in explaining how the brain
    develops. Perhaps there are no simple sub-modules that can be carved
    out, studied in isolation, and reduced. That would be kind of
    annoying.</p>
    <h2 id="a-computational-perspective">A computational
    perspective</h2>
    <p>But explanations in terms of genes feel very unsatisfactory
    anyway. If I ask “How does a computer work?” it is not technically
    <em>wrong</em> to give me an explanation of the chip-making
    procedure.5 But what I actually want to hear is an explanation of
    boolean circuits and perhaps a bit on the theory of computation.
    It’s not actually very useful to understand exactly how a
    microprocessor works at the transistor level - but the theory of
    computation has legs in terms of what it can explain. So are there
    statements about brain development that are flavored a bit more like
    the theory of computation?</p>
    <p>Despite the (somewhat fatalistic) arguments about the possible
    futility of understanding biology, there are also good reasons to
    believe that we <em>can</em> get nice &amp; simple answers. The
    implicit assumption that runs through the “gene-centered”
    perspective outlined in the previous section is that “the genes
    execute a (complicated) program that eventually produces a
    functional body+brain. To understand that process, we have to
    completely reverse-engineer the genetic program.” But as we have
    seen in the videos, a newly born mouse experiences a lot of
    development <em>after</em> birth, at which point the animal is
    already exposed to its environment.</p>
    <p>How exactly does that make it better? Doesn’t that just make it…
    even more complicated? Indeed, the environment can be very hard to
    predict and quite perturbative: predators, conspecifics, seasons,
    losing an eye or a limb, the list goes on and on. It would be very
    hard to come up with individually tailored solutions to compensate
    for all of the possible perturbations. And weirdly enough that’s a
    silver lining! In these situations, where the system is constantly
    perturbed and has to solve a lot of different problems, general
    solutions emerge (often). These general solutions tend to be not
    <em>too</em> complicated and they tend to work well even outside the
    training domain.6 And they are one thing above all: robust to
    perturbations.7</p>
    <h2 id="a-dynamical-system-perspective">A dynamical system
    perspective</h2>
    <p>How do you get robustness? There is a standard answer from
    control theory that generalizes: Tightly coupled feedback loops. And
    indeed there is a very natural candidate for implementing such a
    loop: the reciprocal interaction of developing brain circuits and
    the activity they produce.</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F401db3b2-c23e-4822-b933-e503c4697679_3505x1831.png" /></p>
    <p>The little red triangles and the blue dots are neurons, of
    course.</p>
    <p>The circuit is the network of neurons that emerges over
    development. And these neurons spontaneously produce action
    potentials and excite/inhibit each other8. The developing brain is
    highly active9!</p>
    <p>Here is what the activity looks like in the developing retina,
    with cells that express a specific marker that produces light when
    the neurons are active:</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb121e516-541c-4c9b-9898-e8905075a44b_112x128.gif" /></p>
    <p>The red color indicates “activity”, i.e. those are cells in the
    retina that are firing. In this clip, you cannot actually see
    individual cell bodies, only the simultaneous activity of many
    hundreds/thousands of neurons. source</p>
    <p>These patterns of activity are called “retinal waves” and they
    propagate from the retina to a central relay station and then
    finally into the visual cortex10:</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e445f2-17d3-484f-8f26-6316e2ec7329_300x225.gif" /></p>
    <p>The red color again indicates activity. Here the experimentalists
    managed to record activity from a central relay (SC = superior
    colliculus) and the visual cortex (V1 = primary visual cortex)
    simultaneously, so you can actually see how some of the activity in
    the bottom right translates into activity in the top left. Note that
    while most of the activity in the top left appears to be driven by
    the bottom right, there is also some “additional” activity (the very
    large event at the end) that doesn’t appear to come from the SC.
    source</p>
    <p>But spontaneous activity is only half of the story:</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3271fd27-f082-45fe-8761-dbbbbee7ef84_3505x1831.png" /></p>
    <p>The other half comes from the fact that the circuit organizes
    itself depending on the activity it experiences. In machine
    learning, this is the “gradient descent” that wiggles the parameters
    of the network to improve performance. In neuroscience, it might
    also be gradient descent, but it can also mean the formation or
    removal of connections.</p>
    <p><img
    src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee91a8f1-b8a6-4c9e-a282-622e06176aa4_236x236.gif" /></p>
    <p>The yellow dot marks where they are shooting a laser at the
    neuron to stimulate it. A few seconds later the neuron reaches out
    to form a new connection.</p>
    <p>Exploring these rules for reshaping the brain is perhaps the most
    exciting thing we do at the lab where I do my Ph.D. The most famous
    principle is probably the Hebbian postulate (“Cells that fire
    together, wire together”), but there is a lot more nuance to be
    explored. Changes in the circuit depend on the exact timing of
    neural activity (on the scale of milliseconds), the type of cell
    experiencing the change, the location of the connection on the
    neuron, and is modulated depending on the context. But the big
    picture that emerges is that these changes coordinate to increase
    the computational capabilities, stability, and flexibility of the
    circuit.</p>
    <p>Not only is the interaction between activity and plasticity
    goal-directed in the sense of making the circuit more capable. It is
    also very robust: f.e. if the animal loses an eye and thus receives
    less input to the brain, the brain will increase the amount of input
    from other sources until it again reaches the “correct” level. But
    what is the “correct” level? What is the goal of development?</p>
    <h2
    id="development-might-be-establishing-a-prior-for-predictive-processing">Development
    might be establishing a prior for predictive processing</h2>
    <p>A particularly powerful theory of how the mind works is the
    “predictive processing” theory.11 In this theory, the brain is
    constantly generating and updating a mental model of the
    environment. The model is used to generate predictions of sensory
    input that are compared to actual sensory input. This comparison
    results in prediction errors that are used to update and revise the
    mental model. Hence, the “goal” of the brain is to arrive at a
    mental model that is really good at predicting sensory input. And,
    in this view, the “goal of development” would be to prepare the
    brain as well as possible for predicting future sensory input.
    Development establishes “prior knowledge” that is useful for
    understanding the world.</p>
    <p>There is a bit of evidence for something like this. Here are some
    of my favorites:</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>“Spontaneous cortical activity reveals hallmarks of an
    optimal internal model of the environment”</p></li>
    <li><p>“Retinal waves prime visual motion detection by simulating

    Patterns”</p></li>
    <li><p>“Slow Feature Analysis on Retinal Waves Leads to V1 Complex
    Cells“</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is about as far as the field has come, i.e. this is the
    “state of the art”. This is a bit of a shame because it is <em>only
    just starting to get interesting</em>. I have so many more
    questions:</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>What can we say about this prior?</p></li>
    <li><p>How much/what kind of information is contained in spontaneous
    activity?</p></li>
    <li><p>Is this prior “just” for sensory and motor cortices, or might
    it also extend to higher cortical function?</p></li>
    <li><p>Where does the prior come from (probably evolution, but when
    and can we identify changes over time)?</p></li>
    <li><p>Under which circumstances is it possible to “bootstrap” a
    prior in this fashion (changes in circuit → changes in activity →
    changes in changes in circuit → …)?</p></li>
    <li><p>How might a developmental prior relate to large
    pretrained/foundational models in ML?</p></li>
    <li><p>Can we apply some of the techniques/vocabulary from the
    theory of computation to this domain?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I ever get to have my own research lab, these are questions I
    would love to work on.</p>
