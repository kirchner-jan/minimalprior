    <p>As some of you might have read, I recently <a

    quipped about</a> how I have no expertise in AI. While that was
    perhaps hyperbole, getting up to speed with where AI is heading and
    how to best contribute to that is fun but also a challenge. Luckily,
    I am not alone on my journey into AI alignment research, and I get
    to collaborate <a

    So the timing of joining was also <a

    things are getting more manageable every day.</p>

    <p>At OAI, I go by my middle name (Hendrik) to <a

    some people outside of work, so I tend not to react when anyone
    calls me.</p>
    </div>
    <p>But this little essay is not about alignment research but instead
    about another passion of mine: <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/via-productiva">not
    giving advice</a>. I recently had a <a
    href="https://youtu.be/YO9UiBWx6jw">video call with friends at
    Ought</a> about how I used their tools for academic writing. In that
    call, I got to wax poetically about how large language models can <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/making-of-ian">make
    a researcher’s life easier</a> and how I think about writing text.
    After seeing the video, a few people contacted me to ask more
    questions about my workflow and how I feel about using large
    language models to research. So now I find myself in a bit of an
    awkward position….</p>

    <h3 id="why-i-shouldnt-write-this">Why I shouldn’t write this</h3>
    <p>First off, I’m not a fan of belaboring a process. <a
    href="https://xkcd.com/1827/">XKCD said all that needs to be
    said</a>, reality is not a nice linear sequence of events where
    cause and effect are visible on the surface but rather a <a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/kxs3eeEti9ouwWFzr">weird mess
    of causally entangled stuff</a>.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_86.png" /></p>
    <p>A better strategy than <a
    href="https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/posts/bc/">behaviorally
    cloning</a> the process of someone who claims to have it figured out
    is to identify the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">underlying</a>
    <a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/pdaGN6pQyQarFHXF4/reward-is-not-the-optimization-target">generators</a>
    that produce their success. That’s easier said than done, though,
    and I have no reliable method for finding generators (yet).</p>
    <p>Second, even though I still do research, I write more code than
    prose these days. So my writing muscle has atrophied a little
    bit<sup>[2]</sup>. It would be silly to restart with a post on how I
    write.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[2] </p>
    <p>And it’s conceited to assume that you have a writing muscle in
    the first place. Do as I say, not as I do.</p>
    </div>
    <p>And yet, here we are.</p>
    <p>I decided to reject the second argument above because <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/the-tale-of-gandhi-and-the-devil?r=7inm4&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=#details">it
    is self-reinforcing</a>. Not writing because I have not written
    recently is - quite clearly - a lousy reason. After not having
    written for a while, writing about how I write seems appropriately
    self-referential for this Substack. And finally, with prose and code
    <a
    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04383-z">converging
    rapidly</a>, a reflection on the architecture of text might provide
    unexpected insights into <a
    href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators">how
    AI thinks</a>. And maybe looking at my process allows some people to
    derive a generator<sup>[3]</sup>. Sooo~</p>

    <p>My writing framework is called the ‘TSPSI’<sup>[4]</sup>
    framework. I picked it up at some point during my Ph.D. and can’t
    find a reference for it online, but I’m almost sure it’s <a
    href="https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0LCqKL89KNzcxYPQSTS1LLaosycjMS1fILFZIVChKzc2sAADuNQzM&amp;q=everything+is+a+remix&amp;oq=Everything+is+a+rem&amp;aqs=chrome.1.0i355i512j46i512j69i57j0i512l2j46i512j0i512l4.3545j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#:~:text=with%20Site%20Links-,Everything%20is%20a%20Remix,https%3A//www.everythingisaremix.info,-The%20site%20about">not

    <p>Just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?</p>

    <p>The idea is to think of writing as a report of “travel through <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/map-and-territory-sequence">treacherous
    territory</a>.” In particular,</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>you are <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&amp;t=900s&amp;ab_channel=UChicagoSocialSciences">writing</a><em><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&amp;t=900s&amp;ab_channel=UChicagoSocialSciences">for
    a reader</a></em>. If you care about your reader, try to make things
    pleasant for them. Realize that they know different things than you,
    and try to keep <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inferential-distance">inferential
    distances</a> small.</p></li>
    <li><p>Aspire to be objective but realize that the product will be
    subjective. Describe your travel as accurately as possible (no
    embellishments!), but be <a
    href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/calibration">aware of the
    limitations</a> of your perceptions.</p></li>
    <li><p>realize that your writing mirrors a journey. There will be a
    start and an end, and you are moving through the territory step by
    step. Keep in mind where you want to end up.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img

    take: prompt engineering for language models will not be a thing
    anymore soon, but will be much stickier for image generation</p>
    <p>With these points in mind, here are the five stations you want to
    visit in everything you write.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_88.png" /></p>
    <p>What are you writing about? Where in the territory are we? Why
    should the reader care?</p>
    <p>This section is the easiest to write and the easiest to neglect.
    The more familiar you are with the territory, the more you’ll forget
    about how non-obvious it is to get there.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_89.png" /></p>
    <p>What have other people (or you) said previously about the
    territory? What does the surrounding territory look like?</p>
    <p>This section can quickly grow out of control if you attempt a
    complete description of the surrounding territory. A full report is
    not necessary or desirable. Compress and remove.</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_90.png" /></p>
    <p>What are the wrinkles in the landscape? Where is the terrain
    foggy/uncharted?</p>
    <p>This section puts the reader into your shoes at the onset of your
    travel. Describe what sparked your interest and what you <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns#:~:text=Known%20unknowns%20refers%20to%20%22risks,they%20would%20not%20be%20considered.">knew
    you didn’t know</a>.</p>

    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_91.png" /></p>
    <p>How did your travel go? What did you see?</p>
    <p>Here is what the landscape looks like (I went out and
    looked)/Here is what I think it should look like (I thought about it
    very hard)/here is how I feel the wrinkles can be reconciled (I paid
    attention to these details that have been neglected before)/…</p>
    <p><img
    src="../../images/https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32_92.png" /></p>
    <p>What’s next?</p>
    <p>Now that we have an improved view of the territory, we can
    describe ‘<a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/on-not-reading-papers">the
    delta</a>’ and the new territory that has become accessible. Again,
    be humble (don’t oversell) but also keep in mind that you are in the
    best position to see the new territory, given how familiar you are
    with your work.</p>
    <h3 id="musings">Musings</h3>
    <p>While the TSPSI framework was introduced to me as a framework for
    academic writing, I’m applying it much more broadly. For example,
    whenever I have a blank page in front of me that I want to fill with
    words, I create five headers and write down thoughts as they appear
    in the appropriate section. This is particularly fun with a tool
    like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, where I
    can drag and drop thoughts from outside the workspace into the list
    and rearrange things on the fly.</p>
    <p>When fleshing out the sections, I tend to use <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/making-of-ian">language
    models</a> to expand my notes into prose. But, perhaps most
    important lesson I’ve learned in the last year is that <a
    href="https://generative.ink/posts/loom-interface-to-the-multiverse/">resampling
    is a superpower</a> - a small language model that produces
    completions fast (so that Idon’tdiscard completions I don’t like)
    can be much more useful than a larger language model that is slow
    (so that I can only get one completion).</p>
    <p>This way, I can get to a first draft very fast; but to go from
    there to something I am satisfied with still requires substantial
    iterations of editing;</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>from fanciful renaming (‘Solution to the state of the art’ →
    ‘Je vous présente <del>TSPSI</del>’)</p></li>
    <li><p>and merging sections (‘state of the art’ &amp; ‘problem with
    the state of the art’ → ‘Why I shouldn’t write this’)</p></li>
    <li><p>to liberally reinterpreting the function of sections (‘It’s
    been a minute and darn, I’ve missed you.’)</p></li>
    <li><p>and layering in a second theme (self-reference, this very
    sentence).</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The amount of time we can invest in working on a text is
    unbounded. But clearly, quality of writing increases asymptotically
    at best. Formalizing the gradient that people follow when improving
    a text is an important open problem, with possible solutions being
    <a href="https://openai.com/blog/critiques/">critiques</a> or <a
    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14217">diffusion</a>. I’ve
    experimented with AI-powered versions of these things, but none of
    the existing solutions are quite as good as getting human feedback
    or going through the pain of editing the text myself again and
    again. So, for now, editing is still the slowest part of the writing
    process for me.</p>
    <p>Having revealed my secret sauce for writing, consider going
    through some of my older posts, such as</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p><a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/the-greedy-doctor-problem">The
    greedy doctor problem</a></p></li>

    Unreasonable Feasibility Of Playing Chess Under The
    Influence</a></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>and see if you can recover the TSPSI framework ;)</p>
    <h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
    <p>I’m happy to have written this! I’ve wanted to have a reference
    for the TSPSI framework for a while, and I also enjoy being able to
    click the “publish” button once again. I hope that, despite my
    general skepticism of advice, the ideas in this post can be useful
    for other people.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I always feel a bit dissatisfied about posts
    that don’t have any data or simulations. But those also tend to take
    a lot more time, and clash a bit with what I do in my dayjob, so I’m
    a bit hesitant to go in that direction. Hopefully, sometime soon
    I’ll return to that. Let me know what you think!</p>
