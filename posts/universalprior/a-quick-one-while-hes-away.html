    <p>My earliest best friend from school is named Jan.¬†Later in high
    school, three out of four people in my group of closest friends were
    also called Jan.¬†In university, I had three flatmates whose name
    was, I kid you not, also Jan<sup>[1]</sup>. We all had middle names
    that we used to differentiate ourselves, so throughout my childhood
    and teenage years, I was always called Jan <em>Hendrik</em>. It was
    very weird for me when I moved further south and people called me
    <em>just</em> Jan because there were no other Jans around. I almost
    felt <a

    <p>Why am I bringing this up? No particular reason.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Let‚Äôs put the punchline first: A few weeks ago, I joined the <a
    href="https://openai.com/alignment/">Alignment Team</a> at OpenAI!
    üéâ Everything is super exciting, and everybody is super nice to me!
    I‚Äôm working remotely now, but I hope to move to the bay area soon.
    Moving to the bay <a
    href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M5GoKkWtBKEGMCFHn/what-s-the-theory-of-change-of-come-to-the-bay-over-the">appears
    to be a very hip thing among EAs</a>, so I‚Äôm looking forward to
    meeting as many interesting people as possible.</p>
    <p>I have a great story to tell about how this new job came about,
    involving me teaching myself how to code in the hope of building an
    AI, reading about the <a
    href="https://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox">AI box
    experiment</a>, and studying brains to understand how cognition
    comes about. But I‚Äôm not a big fan of personal
    mythologies<sup>[2]</sup>, so I‚Äôll admit that I simply got
    seduced<sup>[3]</sup> by one of the most interesting<sup>[4]</sup>
    problems out there. And I‚Äôm pretty happy about getting to work on
    that full-time.</p>

    <p>My new job is also why I‚Äôve been uncharacteristically quiet for
    the last two weeks on this Substack. The problem is not that I am
    ‚Äútoo busy to write‚Äù. I have <a
    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/slightly-advanced-decision-theory?s=w">previously
    professed my belief</a> that I want to do <em><strong>all the
    things</strong></em> to maximize positive impact<sup>[5]</sup>. I
    haven‚Äôt changed my mind about that; the problem is that there is
    currently a lot of ‚Äúrenovation‚Äù going on in my head. I‚Äôm moving a
    lot of neuroscience knowledge from working memory to my cerebral
    basement, and I‚Äôm doing a <em>lot</em> of updates on all kinds of
    beliefs. I <em>am</em> working on some more posts, and I have more
    collaborations in the pipeline, but I‚Äôm running out of swap space
    very fast<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
    <div class="sidenote">
    <p>[6] </p>
    <p>Now I realize that the previous paragraph <em>is</em> just a
    roundabout way of saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too busy to write‚Äù‚Ä¶ Oh well üòÑ I
    <em>am</em> optimistic about returning to my previous schedule.</p>

    href="https://kirchner-jan.github.io/minimalprior/posts/universalprior/making-of-ian">IAN</a>niversary
    is coming up, I want to write some retrospective on my PhD, and
    there is a post on Hebbian learning and the covariance rule that
    feels relevant for <a
